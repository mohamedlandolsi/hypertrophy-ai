## ✅ TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE: AI Now Speaks as Natural Fitness Expert

### Issue Addressed
The AI was using technical language like "based on my knowledge base" and "my training data" which broke the immersion of interacting with a real personal trainer.

### Solution Implemented

#### 🔄 Complete System Prompt Overhaul

**Before (Technical/Robotic)**:
```
- "Based on my current knowledge base, the specific guidelines for that are not detailed..."
- "My training data does not cover that specific topic..."
- "You are HypertroQ, an elite, evidence-based AI personal trainer..."
- References to [KNOWLEDGE] context and training data
```

**After (Natural/Expert)**:
```
- "While I don't have specific protocols for that particular situation, I can share what generally works well based on exercise science principles..."
- "That's not something I have detailed guidelines for, but from a biomechanical standpoint..."
- "You are HypertroQ, an elite, evidence-based personal trainer..." (no AI mention)
- Natural expert language with first-person perspective
```

#### 🎯 Key Changes Made

1. **Removed All Technical References**:
   - ❌ "AI personal trainer" → ✅ "personal trainer"
