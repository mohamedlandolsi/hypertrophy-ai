## 🔄 Migration Path for Scripts

If you have external references to scripts, update paths:

**Before:**
```bash
node check-ai-config.js

```

**After:**
```bash
node scripts/check-ai-config.js
node scripts/debug-rag-system.js

## 📝 Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Files

**Documentation:**
```bash
touch docs/NEW_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
```

**Scripts:**
```bash
touch scripts/test-new-feature.js

**Migrations:**
```bash
touch migrations/add-feature-column.sql
# Or use Prisma
npx prisma migrate dev --name feature_name
```

**Backups:**
```bash
node scripts/backup-data.js  # Auto-saves to backups/
```

### Periodic Cleanup

1. Archive outdated documentation (quarterly)
2. Remove obsolete scripts (with feature removals)
3. Clean old backups (follow retention policy)
4. Update README files (as needed)
