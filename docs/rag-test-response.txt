To optimize for muscle hypertrophy, the best exercises are those that allow for high mechanical tension, which is achieved by using a high load and getting close to or to failure (0-2 RIR) within a 5-10 repetition range with good technique. Additionally, choosing exercises that you enjoy and that have a resistance profile matching the muscle's best leverage will enhance results.

Here are some specific exercise recommendations based on the scientific reference material:

*   **Quadriceps:** To train the entire quadriceps, a **leg extension** is recommended. For balanced regional hypertrophy, add a **squat** or **leg press** pattern. Squats and leg presses primarily train the vastus heads but not the rectus femoris.
*   **Glutes:** Effective exercises include **hip thrusts**, **glute bridges**, **cable kickbacks**, **abduction or extension movements** (like cable with cuff around the elbow, seated on a bench, unilateral), **squat patterns**, **leg press**, **split squat patterns**, and **Romanian deadlifts**.
*   **Upper Back (Trapezius, Rhomboids, Posterior Deltoids):** A **chest supported row machine** or a **chest supported T-bar row** with an arm angle of around 60 to 90 degrees is effective for training all upper back muscles.

It's important to note that free weights are not superior to machines or cables for muscle hypertrophy. Machines often provide better stability and can be safer, especially for beginners. Stabilizer muscles are stimulated in both free weight and machine exercises performing the same movement. Muscle damage and time under tension are not beneficial for hypertrophy, and "pump" does not matter for muscle growth.
