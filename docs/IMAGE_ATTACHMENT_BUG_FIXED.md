# Image Attachment Bug Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
**Bug**: When sending an image in a chat message, the image remained attached to the message input field even after the message was successfully sent. This created a poor user experience as users would see their previously uploaded images still in the input area.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the chat page's message sending logic (`src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`):

1. **Primary Issue**: The `sendMessage` function was clearing the text input (`setInput('')`) but not clearing the image-related state variables:
   - `selectedImages` (array of selected File objects)
   - `imagePreviews` (array of preview URLs)

2. **Secondary Issue**: The `onSubmit` function had references to undefined legacy state variables (`selectedImage`, `imagePreview`) that were causing potential errors and redundant clearing logic.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Image State Clearing in `sendMessage` Function
**Location**: `src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`, line ~180

**Before**:
```typescript
setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMessage]);
setInput('');

// Use local variable instead of stale state
let tempConversationId = conversationId;
```

**After**:
```typescript
setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMessage]);
setInput('');
// Clear selected images after sending
setSelectedImages([]);
setImagePreviews([]);

// Use local variable instead of stale state
let tempConversationId = conversationId;
```

### 2. Cleaned Up `onSubmit` Function
**Location**: `src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`, line ~810

**Before**: Function referenced undefined variables and had redundant clearing logic
**After**: Simplified function that relies on `sendMessage` to handle all state clearing

**Key Changes**:
- Removed references to undefined `selectedImage` and `imagePreview` variables
- Removed redundant image clearing logic (now handled by `sendMessage`)
- Simplified dependency array to only include actual variables

## Technical Details

### Image State Management
The chat page uses two main state variables for multi-image support:
- `selectedImages`: Array of File objects representing selected images
- `imagePreviews`: Array of data URLs for image previews

### Message Flow
1. User selects images → `selectedImages` and `imagePreviews` are populated
2. User types message and submits → `onSubmit` calls `sendMessage`
3. `sendMessage` processes the message and images → Clears all input states
4. Chat UI updates with new message → Input area is clean for next message

## Testing
- ✅ Build verification: `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No undefined variable references
- ✅ Clean state management flow

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`
   - Enhanced `sendMessage` function to clear image states
   - Cleaned up `onSubmit` function to remove undefined variable references

## Prevention
This fix ensures that:
1. All image-related state is properly cleared after sending a message
2. The input area is clean and ready for the next message
3. No undefined variables cause runtime errors
4. Consistent state management across the chat functionality

## User Experience Impact
- ✅ Images no longer remain attached after sending
- ✅ Clean input experience for subsequent messages
- ✅ Professional, bug-free chat interface
- ✅ Improved multi-image upload workflow
