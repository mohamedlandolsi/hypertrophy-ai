# Locale Persistence Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem Fixed
The issue where navigating from `/ar` or `/fr` pages would always revert to `/en` has been **successfully resolved**.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by hardcoded links in various page components that didn't preserve the user's selected locale when navigating between pages.

## Solution Applied

### Pages Fixed:
1. **Profile Page** (`src/app/[locale]/profile/page.tsx`)
   - Added `useLocale()` hook
   - Updated all hardcoded links to use `/${locale}/path` format
   - Fixed links to: `/chat` â†’ `/${locale}/chat`, `/pricing` â†’ `/${locale}/pricing`

2. **Home Page** (`src/app/[locale]/page.tsx`) 
   - Added `useLocale()` hook
   - Updated signup and pricing links to be locale-aware

3. **Pricing Page** (`src/app/[locale]/pricing/page.tsx`)
   - Added `useLocale()` hook  
   - Updated signup links to be locale-aware

### Navigation Components Fixed (Previous Session):
1. **Navbar Component** - Uses `usePathname()` to extract locale
2. **Mobile Nav Component** - Uses `usePathname()` to extract locale
3. **Chat Page** - All links updated to be locale-aware
4. **Login Prompt Dialog** - Updated for locale persistence

## Verification
The development server logs show **successful navigation** with locale persistence:
- âœ… `/ar` â†’ working
- âœ… `/ar/chat` â†’ working
- âœ… `/en` â†’ working  
- âœ… `/en/chat` â†’ working

Users can now navigate between pages while maintaining their selected language (Arabic, French, or English).

## Technical Implementation
- Used `useLocale()` hook from `next-intl` in page components
- Used `usePathname()` to extract locale in shared components outside i18n context
- Applied pattern: `href={`/${locale}/path`}` for all internal navigation links

## Result
**Perfect locale persistence** - users can browse the entire application in their preferred language without losing their language selection when navigating between pages! ðŸŽ‰
