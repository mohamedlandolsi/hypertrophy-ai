- ✅ Threshold controls for quality management
- ✅ File: `src/app/[locale]/admin/settings/page.tsx`

**Configuration Flow**
```
Admin UI → AIConfiguration → Chat API → Vector Search → Graph RAG
```

### 🤖 5. Full Application Integration

**Chat API Enhancement**
- ✅ Automatic use of enhanced `hybridSearch()`
- ✅ All configuration settings passed through
- ✅ Graph RAG integration with fallback handling
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ File: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Knowledge Management**
- ✅ Document upload triggers graph building
- ✅ Category-based organization
- ✅ Exercise database integration
- ✅ Vector embedding automation

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### End-to-End Testing
- ✅ `test-end-to-end-rag.js` - Comprehensive system validation
- ✅ `test-graph-rag.js` - Graph RAG specific testing
- ✅ `test-knowledge-graph.js` - Knowledge graph validation
- ✅ `scripts/test-full-integration.js` - Integration verification

### Current System Status
```
📊 Database Status:
   • Knowledge chunks: 1,343 (all with embeddings)
   • Knowledge items: 121
   • Categories: 17 with content distribution
   • Exercises: 52 across 12 muscle groups

🔧 Configuration Status:
   • Graph RAG: ENABLED
   • Graph search weight: 0.9
   • RAG threshold: 0.05
   • Strict muscle priority: TRUE
   • All controls functional in admin UI

✅ Build Status:
   • ESLint: ✔ No warnings or errors
   • TypeScript: ✔ No type errors
   • Next.js build: ✔ Successful compilation
```

## 🎯 Key Integration Points

1. **Configuration Propagation**: Admin settings → Database → API → Search logic
2. **Search Pipeline**: Vector + Keyword + Graph → Hybrid results → Chat response
3. **Document Processing**: Upload → Chunking → Embedding → Graph building
4. **Quality Control**: Thresholds and weights ensure relevant, high-quality responses

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### ✅ What's Working
- All RAG components fully integrated and functional
- Complete admin control system operational
- Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Clean build with no lint errors

### 📋 Optional Enhancements (Future)
- Neo4j cluster setup for production Graph RAG
- Advanced graph visualization in admin interface
- A/B testing framework for prompt optimization
- Real-time analytics dashboard for search performance

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

1. **Access Admin Controls**: Go to `/admin/settings` to configure all RAG features
2. **Toggle Graph RAG**: Use the `enableGraphRAG` switch to enable/disable graph search
3. **Adjust Weights**: Use sliders to balance vector vs. keyword vs. graph search importance
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check browser console for search pipeline logging
5. **Test Changes**: Use the chat interface to validate configuration changes
