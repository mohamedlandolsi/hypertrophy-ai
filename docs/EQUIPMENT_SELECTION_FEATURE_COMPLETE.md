## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **1. Data Structure**

**Interface Update:**
```typescript
interface CustomizationConfig {
  structureId: string;
  categoryType: 'MINIMALIST' | 'ESSENTIALIST' | 'MAXIMALIST';
  workoutConfiguration: Record<string, string[]>;
  weeklyScheduleMapping?: Record<string, string>;
  workoutPattern?: number;
  exerciseSets?: Record<string, Record<string, number>>;
  exerciseEquipment?: Record<string, Record<string, string>>; // NEW!
  // templateId -> exerciseId -> selected equipment
}
```

### **2. State Management**

**Equipment State:**
```typescript
const [exerciseEquipment, setExerciseEquipment] = useState<Record<string, Record<string, string>>>(
  userCustomization?.configuration?.exerciseEquipment || {}
);
```

**State Structure:**
```typescript
{
  "workout-template-id": {
    "exercise-id-1": "Dumbbells",
    "exercise-id-2": "Barbell",
    "exercise-id-3": "Cables"
  }
}
```

### **3. Helper Functions**

**Get Equipment:**
```typescript
const getExerciseEquipment = (templateId: string, exerciseId: string) => {
  return exerciseEquipment[templateId]?.[exerciseId] || '';
};
```

**Set Equipment:**
```typescript
const setExerciseEquipmentChoice = (templateId: string, exerciseId: string, equipment: string) => {
  setExerciseEquipment(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [templateId]: {
      ...(prev[templateId] || {}),
      [exerciseId]: equipment
    }
  }));
  setHasUnsavedChanges(true);
};
```

### **4. UI Component**

**Equipment Selector:**
```typescript
<Select
  value={getExerciseEquipment(template.displayId, exercise.id) || exercise.equipment[0] || ''}
  onValueChange={(value) => setExerciseEquipmentChoice(template.displayId, exercise.id, value)}
>
  <SelectTrigger className="w-24 h-7 text-xs">
    <SelectValue placeholder="Equipment" />
  </SelectTrigger>
  <SelectContent>
    {exercise.equipment.map((equip) => (
      <SelectItem key={equip} value={equip}>{equip}</SelectItem>
    ))}
  </SelectContent>
</Select>
```

### **5. Display Logic**

**Equipment Display Below Exercise Name:**
```typescript
<p className="text-xs text-gray-500 truncate">
  {getExerciseEquipment(template.displayId, exercise.id) || exercise.equipment[0] || 'Select equipment'} • {Math.round(volumeContribution * 100)}% volume
</p>
```

Shows:
- Selected equipment if chosen
- First equipment option as default
- "Select equipment" if no options available

### **6. Save Function Update**

**Includes Equipment in Save:**
```typescript
const saveWorkoutConfiguration = async (workoutDisplayId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/programs/customize', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      trainingProgramId: program.id,
      customization: {
        // ... other fields
        exerciseSets: exerciseSets,
        exerciseEquipment: exerciseEquipment // NEW!
      }
    })
  });
};
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

### **What Gets Saved:**
```json
{
  "exerciseEquipment": {
    "workout-1": {
      "exercise-123": "Dumbbells",
      "exercise-456": "Cables"
    },
    "workout-2": {
      "exercise-789": "Barbell"
    }
  }
}
```

### **When It Saves:**

- Loaded on next visit

### **Database Field:**
- Stored in `UserProgramCustomization.configuration.exerciseEquipment`

---

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Selector Styling:**
- **Width:** `w-24` (96px) - fits most equipment names
- **Height:** `h-7` (28px) - matches sets selector
- **Text Size:** `text-xs` - consistent with other controls
- **Placeholder:** "Equipment" when empty

### **Layout:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Image] Exercise Name ⭐                  │
│         Selected Equipment • 100% volume  │
│                                           │
│ Controls: [ℹ️] [Equipment▼] [Sets▼] [X]  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Responsive Behavior:**
- **Desktop:** All controls in one row
- **Mobile:** Controls may wrap if needed
- **Compact:** Minimal spacing between controls

---

## 🔄 State Synchronization

### **On Load:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (userCustomization) {
    setExerciseEquipment(
      userCustomization.configuration?.exerciseEquipment || {}
    );
  }
}, [userCustomization]);
```

### **On Change:**
```typescript
setExerciseEquipmentChoice(templateId, exerciseId, equipment);
// Marks workout as having unsaved changes
setHasUnsavedChanges(true);
```

### **On Save:**
```typescript
// Sends exerciseEquipment to API
// Updates database
// Refreshes UI with saved data
```
