# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test Guide - Exercise Images

## âœ… The Fix is Applied!

The race condition in image upload has been resolved. Images will now save to the database correctly.

---

## ðŸ§ª Test in 3 Steps:

### **Step 1: Test Display (Existing Data)**
```powershell
# Already done - "Chest Press" exercise has an image
# Just refresh your Exercise Management page and look for it!
```

### **Step 2: Test Upload (New Image)**
1. Open Exercise Management as admin
2. Create or edit an exercise
3. Select an image (JPG/PNG/GIF under 10MB)
4. Wait for preview
5. Click "Save"
6. **Image should appear in the table!**

### **Step 3: Verify Database**
```powershell
node check-exercise-image-urls.js
```

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Where Images Appear:

1. **Exercise Management Table** (48x48px thumbnails)
2. **Program Customizer - Selected Exercises** (40x40px)
3. **Program Customizer - Add Exercise Modal** (64x64px)

---

## ðŸ”§ If Issues Persist:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Check Network tab** for API responses
3. **Run diagnostic:**
   ```powershell
   node debug-exercise-images.js
   ```

---

## âœ¨ What Changed:

**Fixed race condition where `formData` state wasn't updated before API call.**

Now uses the return value from upload directly:
```javascript
const imageData = await handleImageUpload();
const payload = { ...formData, ...imageData };
```

**Ready to test! ðŸš€**
