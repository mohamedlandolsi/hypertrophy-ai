# Theme Color Improvements Summary

## Overview
Updated both light and dark mode themes to provide more pleasing, comfortable, and readable color schemes.

## Light Mode Improvements

### Before (Issues):
- Pure white background (`oklch(1 0 0)`) - too bright, eye strain
- Pure black text (`oklch(0.145 0 0)`) - too harsh contrast
- Grayscale primary colors - lacked engagement
- Cold gray borders - felt sterile

### After (Solutions):
- **Background**: `oklch(0.98 0.005 0)` - Soft off-white with subtle warmth
- **Text**: `oklch(0.18 0.01 0)` - Warm dark gray, easier on eyes
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.35 0.08 240)` - Soft blue-gray for better engagement
- **Borders**: `oklch(0.88 0.01 0)` - Warmer, softer appearance
- **Muted Text**: `oklch(0.48 0.02 0)` - Improved contrast ratio

## Dark Mode Improvements

### Before (Issues):
- Very dark background (`oklch(0.145 0 0)`) - too dark, content hard to see
- Harsh white text (`oklch(0.985 0 0)`) - eye strain in dark environment
- Washed out primary colors - poor visibility
- Very dark cards - content didn't stand out

### After (Solutions):
- **Background**: `oklch(0.12 0.01 0)` - Lighter dark for better visibility
- **Text**: `oklch(0.92 0.01 0)` - Softer white for comfortable reading
- **Cards**: `oklch(0.16 0.01 0)` - Lighter surfaces, content stands out
- **Primary**: `oklch(0.75 0.12 240)` - Bright blue for clear actions
- **Muted Text**: `oklch(0.65 0.02 0)` - Better contrast in dark mode
