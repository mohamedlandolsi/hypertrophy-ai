## âœ… Implementation Status: COMPLETED

Both requested features have been successfully implemented:

1. **Delete Chat Confirmation Dialog**: Replaced browser alert with a modern Radix UI dialog
2. **Chat History Pagination**: Added "Load More" functionality to chat history list

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Chat Confirmation Dialog

**Before:**
- Simple JavaScript `confirm()` alert
- Basic yes/no confirmation

**After:**
- Modern Radix UI dialog component
- Professional design with warning indicators
- Chat preview showing what will be deleted
- Clear warning messages about permanent action
- Loading states during deletion
- Accessible and keyboard-friendly

#### Dialog Features:
- **Visual Preview**: Shows the chat title and creation info
- **Warning Section**: Clear red-outlined warning with bullet points
- **Action Buttons**: Cancel (outline) and Delete (destructive red)
- **Loading States**: "Deleting..." with spinner during operation
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### 2. Chat History Pagination

**Before:**
- All chats loaded at once
- Could be slow with many conversations

**After:**
- Paginated loading (10 chats per page)
- "Load More Chats" button at bottom
- Loading states for better UX
- Efficient API queries with pagination

#### Pagination Features:
- **Initial Load**: First 10 chats
- **Load More Button**: Appears when more chats available
- **Loading States**: Shows "Loading..." during fetch
- **Seamless UX**: New chats append to existing list
- **Auto-hide**: Button disappears when all chats loaded

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### `src/app/api/conversations/route.ts`
- Added pagination parameters (`page`, `limit`)
- Added pagination response metadata
- Efficient database queries with `skip` and `take`

```typescript
// Pagination support
const page = parseInt(searchParams.get('page') || '1', 10);
const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get('limit') || '10', 10);
const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

// Response with pagination info
return NextResponse.json({ 
  conversations: formattedConversations,
  pagination: {
    page,
    limit,
    totalCount,
    totalPages,
    hasMore
  }
});
```

### Frontend Changes

#### `src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
// Pagination state
const [chatHistoryPage, setChatHistoryPage] = useState(1);
const [hasMoreChats, setHasMoreChats] = useState(false);
const [isLoadingMoreChats, setIsLoadingMoreChats] = useState(false);

// Delete dialog state
const [deleteDialogOpen, setDeleteDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [chatToDelete, setChatToDelete] = useState<{ id: string; title: string } | null>(null);
const [isDeletingChat, setIsDeletingChat] = useState(false);
```

**Updated Functions:**
- `loadChatHistory()`: Now supports pagination with `append` parameter
- `loadMoreChats()`: New function for loading additional chats
- `handleDeleteChat()`: Opens dialog instead of browser confirm
- `confirmDeleteChat()`: Actual deletion logic with loading states

**UI Components:**
- Added Load More button with loading states
- Added comprehensive delete confirmation dialog
- Integrated with existing design system

### Translation Updates

Added new translation keys in all language files:

#### English (`messages/en.json`)
```json
"sidebar": {
  "loadMore": "Load More Chats",
  "loadingMore": "Loading..."
},
"dialogs": {
  "deleteChat": {
    "title": "Delete Chat",
    "description": "Are you sure you want to delete this conversation?",
    "warningTitle": "Warning: Permanent Action",
    "confirm": "Delete Permanently"
  }
}
```

#### Arabic (`messages/ar.json`)
- Full RTL support for dialog
- Arabic translations for all new strings

#### French (`messages/fr.json`)
- Complete French translations
- Proper linguistic adaptations
