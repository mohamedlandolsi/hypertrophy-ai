# Structure ID Validation Fix

## Problem

Users were experiencing "Save Failed - The specified program structure does not exist" error when trying to save their workout customizations. This occurred when:

1. A user had previously saved a program customization
2. The program's structures were later updated/recreated in the database (e.g., via migration or admin changes)
3. The old structure IDs in the user's saved customization became invalid
4. The component tried to use the invalid saved structure ID, causing the save operation to fail

### Error Message Example:
```
Save Failed
The specified program structure does not exist.
Invalid structure ID: cmgeuejyb0002f4kkezyq3qo3
Valid structure IDs: [
  'cmgqf54oi0000f4c0063y0vaq',
  'cmgqf54oi0001f4c0z0yafy9u',
  'cmgqf54oi0002f4c0xv9snq9t',
  'cmgqf54oi0003f4c0gyjinxir'
]
```

## Root Cause

The program customizer component was blindly trusting the saved `structureId` from the user's previous customization without validating that it still exists in the current program's structures.

### Problematic Code (Before Fix):
```typescript
// Initial state - no validation
const [customization, setCustomization] = useState<CustomizationConfig>(() => ({
  structureId: userCustomization?.configuration?.structureId || /* fallback */,
  // ... other fields
}));

// useEffect sync - no validation
useEffect(() => {
  if (userCustomization) {
    setCustomization({
      structureId: userCustomization.configuration?.structureId || /* fallback */,
      // ... other fields
    });
  }
}, [userCustomization, program.programStructures]);
```

The code would use `userCustomization.configuration?.structureId` directly without checking if that ID exists in `program.programStructures`.

---

## Solution

### 1. **Validation Helper Function**
Created a `getValidStructureId()` function that validates the saved structure ID against the current program's available structures:

```typescript
const getValidStructureId = useCallback(() => {
  // First check if saved structureId exists in current program structures
  const savedStructureId = userCustomization?.configuration?.structureId;
  if (savedStructureId && program.programStructures.some((s: Record<string, unknown>) => s.id === savedStructureId)) {
    return savedStructureId;
  }
  // Fall back to default or first structure
  return program.programStructures.find((s: Record<string, unknown>) => s.isDefault)?.id || program.programStructures[0]?.id || '';
}, [userCustomization?.configuration?.structureId, program.programStructures]);
```

### 2. **Updated Initialization**
Used the validation function in the initial state:

```typescript
const [customization, setCustomization] = useState<CustomizationConfig>(() => ({
  structureId: getValidStructureId(), // ✅ Validated
  categoryType: userCustomization?.categoryType || 'ESSENTIALIST',
  // ... other fields
}));
```

### 3. **Updated Sync Effect**
Applied validation when syncing customization state:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (userCustomization) {
    const validStructureId = getValidStructureId();
    const savedStructureId = userCustomization?.configuration?.structureId;
    
    // Notify user if their saved structure was invalid and has been reset
    if (savedStructureId && savedStructureId !== validStructureId) {
      console.warn('Invalid structure ID detected:', savedStructureId, '- Reset to:', validStructureId);
      toast({
        title: 'Program Structure Updated',
        description: 'Your saved workout structure was outdated and has been reset to the current default. Please review and save your workout again.',
        variant: 'default'
      });
    }
    
    setCustomization({
      structureId: validStructureId, // ✅ Validated
      // ... other fields
    });
  }
}, [userCustomization, program.programStructures, getValidStructureId, toast]);
```

### 4. **User Notification**
Added a toast notification to inform users when their saved structure was invalid and has been automatically reset. This provides transparency and prompts them to review their workout.

---

## Validation Logic Flow

```
User opens program customizer
    ↓
Load userCustomization from database
    ↓
Check: Does saved structureId exist in program.programStructures?
    ↓
    ├─ YES → Use saved structureId ✅
    │         (User's preference preserved)
    │
    └─ NO → Use default or first structure ⚠️
              ↓
              Show toast notification:
              "Your saved workout structure was outdated 
               and has been reset to the current default."
              ↓
              Log warning to console for debugging
              ↓
              User can now customize and save again
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Prevents Save Errors**
- No more "structure does not exist" errors
- Users can always save their workout customizations
- Graceful fallback to valid structure

### ✅ **Maintains Data Integrity**
- Only valid structure IDs are sent to the API
- Database constraints are respected
- No orphaned references

### ✅ **User Transparency**
- Clear notification when structure is reset
- Console warnings for debugging
- Prompts user to review their workout

### ✅ **Backward Compatible**
- Works with existing saved customizations
- Handles program structure updates gracefully
- No data migration required

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Valid Saved Structure
**Given**: User has saved customization with valid structure ID
**When**: User opens program customizer
**Then**: Saved structure is preserved, no notification shown

### Scenario 2: Invalid Saved Structure
**Given**: User has saved customization with outdated structure ID
**When**: User opens program customizer
**Then**: 
- Structure is reset to default/first available
- Toast notification is shown
- Console warning is logged
- User can customize and save again

### Scenario 3: No Saved Customization
**Given**: User has not customized this program before
**When**: User opens program customizer
**Then**: Default or first structure is selected automatically

### Scenario 4: Program Structure Update
**Given**: Admin updates program structures (new IDs)
**When**: User with old customization opens program
**Then**: Old structure ID is detected as invalid and reset gracefully

## Code Changes

- `src/components/programs/program-customizer.tsx`

### Key Changes:
1. Added `getValidStructureId()` validation function (line ~165)
2. Updated initial state to use validation (line ~175)
3. Enhanced sync effect with validation and notification (line ~207)
4. Added toast dependency to useEffect (line ~235)

### Lines of Code:
- Added: ~25 lines (validation logic + notification)
- Modified: 3 locations (initial state + useEffect + dependencies)

## Related Issues

This fix prevents several related error scenarios:

1. **Database Constraint Violations**: API would reject invalid structure IDs
2. **Frontend Errors**: Component would try to find non-existent structures
3. **User Confusion**: Error messages didn't explain how to fix the issue
4. **Data Inconsistency**: Saved customizations referenced deleted structures

---

## Future Improvements

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Migration Script**: Automatically update all saved customizations when structures change
2. **Structure Mapping**: Try to map old structure to equivalent new structure (e.g., by name/type)
3. **Admin Warning**: Notify admins when changing structures that users have saved customizations
4. **Version Tracking**: Add structure version field to detect and handle updates more explicitly

### Database Optimization:
Consider adding a foreign key constraint with `ON DELETE SET NULL` or `ON DELETE CASCADE` to handle structure deletions at the database level.
