# Coach Inbox Feature Implementation Complete

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of the Coach Inbox feature, allowing coaches to receive, view, and respond to messages from users via a dedicated inbox interface.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints
- **`/api/coach-inbox`** - Returns unread count and recent messages for the authenticated coach
- **`/api/coach-inbox/chats`** - Returns paginated list of all coach chats with unread counts
- **`/api/coach-inbox/mark-read`** - Marks messages as read in a specific chat
- **`/api/coach-chat/[chatId]/messages`** - Fetches all messages for a specific coach chat
- **`/api/coach-chat/message`** - Sends new messages in coach chats (existing endpoint)

### 2. User Interface Components

#### Coach Inbox Notification (`src/components/coach-inbox-notification.tsx`)
- Displays in the navbar for users with coach role
- Shows unread message count as a badge
- Dropdown with recent messages and quick navigation
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Links to full inbox and individual chats

#### Coach Inbox Page (`src/app/[locale]/coach-inbox/page.tsx`)
- Full inbox interface with chat list and message view
- Search functionality for conversations
- Real-time message sending and receiving
- Message status indicators (read/unread)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

### 3. Multi-Role Support
- Users can now have multiple roles (e.g., "admin,coach")
- Role checking supports comma-separated values
- Navigation and access controls adapt based on user roles

### 4. Route Protection
- Coach inbox pages require authentication
- Access restricted to users with coach role
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized users

## Database Schema
The feature uses existing schema:
- `CoachChat` model for chat sessions
- `CoachMessage` model for individual messages
- `User` model with multi-role support via comma-separated string

## User Experience Flow

### For Coaches:
1. Coach sees notification icon in navbar when new messages arrive
2. Can click notification to see recent messages or access full inbox
3. In full inbox, can search conversations, view message history, and respond
4. Messages are automatically marked as read when viewed
5. Can access inbox via direct navigation link in navbar

### For Users:
1. Users continue to use existing "Chat with Coach" functionality
2. Messages sent to coaches appear in the coach's inbox
3. No changes to existing user chat experience

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization

### Real-time Features
