# CHUNK DOMINANCE FIXES COMPLETE

## Issue Addressed
The RAG system was experiencing "chunk dominance" where a single knowledge source would monopolize the retrieved context, reducing the diversity and comprehensiveness of AI responses.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Knowledge Base Distribution**: Analysis revealed significant variation in chunk counts across knowledge items:
   - Some guides have 160+ chunks (Full-Body Workouts)
   - Others have 25-75 chunks (specific topics)
   - This natural imbalance creates potential for source dominance

2. **Vector Similarity Bias**: Without diversification, similarity search would return the top N chunks regardless of source, leading to scenarios where all chunks came from a single comprehensive guide.

## Solution Implemented: Source Diversification

### Core Algorithm (in `src/lib/vector-search.ts`)
The `fallbackJsonSimilaritySearch` function now implements a **two-pass source diversification strategy**:

```typescript
// Step 1: Fetch larger candidate pool (3x topK, minimum 15)
const initialFetchLimit = Math.max(topK * 3, 15);
let candidateChunks = sortedSimilarities.slice(0, initialFetchLimit);

// Step 2: Apply high relevance threshold filtering
if (highRelevanceThreshold !== undefined) {
  candidateChunks = candidateChunks.filter(
    chunk => chunk.similarity >= highRelevanceThreshold
  );
}

// Step 3: Source diversification
const diversifiedChunks = [];
const seenKnowledgeIds = new Set();

// First pass: Get best chunk from each unique knowledge item
for (const chunk of candidateChunks) {
  if (diversifiedChunks.length >= topK) break;
  
  if (!seenKnowledgeIds.has(chunk.knowledgeId)) {
    diversifiedChunks.push(chunk);
    seenKnowledgeIds.add(chunk.knowledgeId);
  }
}

// Second pass: Fill remaining slots with highest similarity chunks
if (diversifiedChunks.length < topK) {
  // Add remaining chunks avoiding duplicates
}
```

### Key Features
1. **Source Awareness**: Tracks `knowledgeId` to ensure no source dominates
2. **Quality Preservation**: Maintains similarity-based ranking within source constraints
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If fewer sources exist than requested chunks, fills remaining slots with best available chunks
4. **Configurable**: Works with existing AI configuration (topK, similarity thresholds)

### Logging and Monitoring
Added comprehensive logging to track diversification effectiveness:
```
🔍 Source diversification: 10 chunks from 8 unique sources
📊 Source distribution: {"Guide A": 2, "Guide B": 1, "Guide C": 1, ...}
```

## Verification Methods
1. **Knowledge Distribution Analysis**: Created `check-knowledge-distribution.js` to analyze chunk distribution across sources
2. **Diversification Testing**: Built multiple test scripts to verify the algorithm works correctly
3. **Live API Testing**: Tested real queries through the chat API

## Expected Impact
- **Before**: Single source could provide 100% of chunks (e.g., 20/20 chunks from one guide)
- **After**: Maximum 1 chunk per source in first pass, then fill remaining slots
- **Result**: Improved answer comprehensiveness by drawing from multiple knowledge sources

## Configuration
The system respects existing AI configuration:
- `ragMaxChunks`: Controls total number of chunks retrieved
- `ragSimilarityThreshold`: Filters chunks below similarity threshold  
- `ragHighRelevanceThreshold`: Additional filtering for high-quality chunks

## Backward Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing API
- Fallback behavior maintains existing functionality
- Performance impact is minimal (single database query, in-memory processing)

## Monitoring
The system now logs:
- Number of chunks retrieved
- Number of unique sources represented
- Source distribution breakdown
- Effectiveness of diversification strategy

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The source diversification feature is fully implemented and operational. The RAG system now provides more diverse, comprehensive responses by preventing any single knowledge source from dominating the retrieved context.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/vector-search.ts` - Added source diversification logic
- Created multiple test scripts for verification
- Updated system logging for monitoring

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor real-world usage to validate diversification effectiveness
- Consider adjusting diversification parameters based on user feedback
- Future enhancement: Implement semantic clustering for even better diversity
