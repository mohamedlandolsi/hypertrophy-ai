# Exercise Type System Migration - Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated the exercise system from single `muscleGroup` field to `exerciseType` classification with flexible `volumeContributions` for muscle targeting.

## Migration Details

### Database Changes
- **Removed**: `muscleGroup` field (ExerciseMuscleGroup enum)
- **Added**: `exerciseType` field (COMPOUND | ISOLATION | UNILATERAL) with default COMPOUND
- **Updated**: `volumeContributions` field to store muscle targeting data (JSON object)
- **Indexes**: Updated to use exerciseType instead of muscleGroup

### Code Changes

#### 1. Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
```prisma
model Exercise {
  exerciseType        ExerciseType @default(COMPOUND)
  volumeContributions Json?        @default("{}")
  // muscleGroup removed
}

enum ExerciseType {
  COMPOUND    // Multi-joint, multiple muscle groups
  ISOLATION   // Single-joint, specific muscles
  UNILATERAL  // Single-limb movements
}
```

#### 2. Admin Exercise Management (`src/components/admin/exercise-management.tsx`)
- Replaced muscle group dropdown with exercise type selector
- Updated UI to show exercise type badges with color coding:
  - Purple: COMPOUND
  - Blue: ISOLATION
  - Green: UNILATERAL
- Updated filters to work with exercise type
- Removed legacy muscle group constants

#### 3. Program Customizer (`src/components/programs/program-customizer.tsx`)
- Updated exercise filtering to check `volumeContributions` instead of `muscleGroup`
- Exercise now matches muscle group if it has any volume contribution for that muscle
- Code: `Object.keys(exercise.volumeContributions).some(muscle => muscle.toLowerCase() === muscleGroup.toLowerCase())`

#### 4. API Routes
- **GET /api/admin/exercises**: Now filters and orders by `exerciseType`
- **POST /api/admin/exercises**: Validates `exerciseType` and `volumeContributions`
- **PUT /api/admin/exercises/[id]**: Updates `exerciseType` instead of `muscleGroup`

#### 5. Exercise Validation Library (`src/lib/exercise-validation.ts`)
- Updated `Exercise` interface with new fields
- `getExercisesByMuscleGroup()`: Filters by checking `volumeContributions` keys
- `generateExerciseContext()`: Groups exercises by type, shows target muscles
- `getExerciseStats()`: Groups statistics by exercise type
- Fixed type casting for Prisma's JsonValue to Record<string, number>

## Volume Contribution System

### Concept
Volume contributions define how much each exercise targets specific muscles:
- **1.0**: Primary target (direct, main working muscle)
- **0.75**: Strong secondary (heavily involved)
- **0.5**: Standard secondary (moderately involved)
- **0.25**: Light secondary/stabilizer (minimal contribution)
- **0**: Not targeted (no contribution - omit from object)

### Example Configurations

#### Compound Exercises
```json
// Bench Press
{
  "CHEST": 1.0,
  "FRONT_DELTS": 0.5,
  "TRICEPS": 0.5
}

// Squat
{
  "QUADRICEPS": 1.0,
  "GLUTES": 0.75,
  "HAMSTRINGS": 0.5
}

// Deadlift
{
  "LATS": 1.0,
  "TRAPEZIUS": 0.75,
  "GLUTES": 0.75,
  "HAMSTRINGS": 0.75,
  "RHOMBOIDS": 0.5
}

// Romanian Deadlift
{
  "HAMSTRINGS": 1.0,
  "GLUTES": 0.75,
  "LATS": 0.25,
  "TRAPEZIUS": 0.25
}
```

#### Isolation Exercises
```json
// Bicep Curl
{
  "ELBOW_FLEXORS": 1.0
}

// Leg Extension
{
  "QUADRICEPS": 1.0
}
```

#### Unilateral Exercises
```json
// Bulgarian Split Squat
{
  "QUADRICEPS": 1.0,
  "GLUTES": 0.8,
  "HAMSTRINGS": 0.4
}
```

## Available Muscle Groups

- CHEST
- LATS
- TRAPEZIUS_RHOMBOIDS
- FRONT_DELTS
- SIDE_DELTS
- REAR_DELTS

## Admin Next Steps

### Required Actions
All 52 exercises currently have:
- `exerciseType = COMPOUND` (default)
- `volumeContributions = {}` (empty)

Admins need to:

1. **Review Each Exercise**
   - Open admin exercise management page
   - For each exercise, determine correct type:
     - COMPOUND: Multi-joint (bench press, squat, row)
     - ISOLATION: Single-joint (bicep curl, leg extension)
     - UNILATERAL: One-sided (Bulgarian split squat, single-leg press)

2. **Configure Volume Contributions**
   - Define which muscles each exercise targets
   - Assign contribution values (1.0 for primary, 0.5 for secondary, etc.)
   - Example: Bench Press → {"CHEST": 1.0, "FRONT_DELTS": 0.5, "TRICEPS": 0.5}

3. **Prioritize by Usage**
   - Start with APPROVED and active exercises (41 exercises)
   - These are the ones users can currently access
   - PENDING and DEPRECATED can be configured later

### Admin Interface
The admin exercise management page now shows:
- Exercise type selector with descriptions
- Color-coded badges for easy identification
- Filter by exercise type
- Full CRUD operations with new schema

## Testing

### Test Script
Run `node test-exercise-type-system.js` to verify:
- All exercises have exerciseType
- Distribution of exercise types
- Volume contribution status
- Old muscleGroup column is removed
- Database indexes are updated

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/exercises`
- [ ] Verify exercise type selector appears
- [ ] Create a new exercise with type and volume contributions
- [ ] Edit an existing exercise to add volume data
- [ ] Navigate to program customizer
- [ ] Verify exercise filtering works with volume contributions

## Migration Artifacts

## Benefits of New System

1. **More Precise Classification**
   - Exercises now classified by movement pattern (COMPOUND/ISOLATION/UNILATERAL)
   - Better for program design and exercise selection

2. **Flexible Muscle Targeting**
   - Can define multiple muscles per exercise
   - Contribution levels allow nuanced targeting
   - No longer limited to single muscle group

3. **Better AI Integration**
   - AI can understand exercise complexity via type
   - Volume contributions help AI recommend appropriate exercises
   - More accurate exercise context for program generation

4. **Improved User Experience**
   - Exercise filtering by muscle group still works
   - More detailed exercise information
   - Better exercise recommendations

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed (NOT RECOMMENDED - data preserved):
1. Recreate `muscleGroup` column with migration
2. Manually map exercises to muscle groups
3. Revert code changes to previous version
4. Update Prisma schema

**Note**: All 52 exercises were preserved during migration. No data loss occurred.

## Support
