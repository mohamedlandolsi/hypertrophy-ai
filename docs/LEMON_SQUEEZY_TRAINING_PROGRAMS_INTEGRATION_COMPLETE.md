# Lemon Squeezy Training Programs Integration - Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary

Successfully integrated Lemon Squeezy webhook handling for individual training program purchases, extending the existing subscription payment system. The integration maintains clear separation between subscription flows and one-time training program purchases.

## âœ… Implementation Details

### 1. Webhook Handler Modifications
- **File**: `src/app/api/webhooks/lemon-squeezy/route.ts`
- **New Event**: Added `order_created` case to handle training program purchases
- **Function**: `handleOrderCreated()` processes one-time training program sales
- **Separation**: Clear distinction between subscription products and training programs

### 2. Key Features Implemented

#### A. Training Program Purchase Detection
- Identifies training programs by matching `lemonSqueezyId` with product ID
- Skips subscription products (handled by existing subscription events)
- Validates program is active before allowing purchase

#### B. User Validation & Security
- Requires user to be authenticated during purchase (via `custom_data.user_id`)
- Validates user email matches order email
- Prevents duplicate purchases (user can only buy same program once)

#### C. Price Validation
- Compares order total with training program price
- Converts currency to cents for accurate comparison
- Prevents price manipulation attacks

#### D. Database Operations
- Creates `UserPurchase` record linking user to training program
- Creates audit trail for compliance and debugging
- Validates all data before database writes

### 3. Error Handling & Logging
- Comprehensive error messages for debugging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- ValidationError for client-facing issues
- Proper TypeScript error handling

### 4. Testing & Validation
- **Test Script**: `test-webhook-handler.js`
- **Coverage**: All webhook scenarios including edge cases
- **Validation**: Price mismatches, inactive programs, duplicate purchases
- **Cleanup**: Automatic test data cleanup

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### A. Webhook Event Flow
```
order_created event â†’ validate signature â†’ extract product data â†’ 
check if training program â†’ validate user & price â†’ create purchase record â†’ 
create audit trail â†’ log success
```

### B. Database Schema Integration
- Uses existing `TrainingProgram` model with `lemonSqueezyId` field
- Creates `UserPurchase` records for tracking ownership
- Leverages existing audit trail system

### C. Error Scenarios Handled
1. **Missing Product ID**: Logs error and rejects
2. **Subscription Product**: Skips (handled elsewhere)
3. **Unknown Product**: Logs and ignores
4. **Inactive Program**: Rejects with validation error
5. **Missing User**: Requires authentication
6. **Price Mismatch**: Prevents manipulation
7. **Duplicate Purchase**: Prevents but logs as info

## ðŸ§ª Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- âœ… Order_created event structure validated
- âœ… Training program purchase detection working
- âœ… Subscription vs training program differentiation working
- âœ… User lookup and validation working
- âœ… Duplicate purchase protection working
- âœ… Price validation working
- âœ… Database operations working

## ðŸš€ Build Status

- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… Next.js build passes
- âœ… All logging fixed for proper types
- âœ… No runtime errors detected

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

### For Admin Dashboard
- Training programs can be created with `lemonSqueezyId` field
- Programs must be marked as `isActive: true` for purchases
- Use existing admin interface at `/[locale]/admin/programs`

### For Development
- Test webhook with: `node test-webhook-handler.js`
- Webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/lemon-squeezy`
- Logs structured data for debugging

### For Production
- Ensure `LEMONSQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is configured
- Set appropriate Lemon Squeezy product IDs in training programs
- Monitor audit trail for purchase tracking

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

1. **Signature Verification**: All webhooks verified with Lemon Squeezy signature
2. **User Authentication**: Purchases require authenticated user context
3. **Price Validation**: Server-side price verification prevents manipulation
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Database constraints prevent duplicate purchases
5. **Input Validation**: All webhook data validated before processing

## ðŸŽ‰ Integration Complete

The Lemon Squeezy training program integration is fully functional and production-ready. The system now supports both subscription plans and individual training program purchases through a unified webhook handler with proper separation of concerns.

**Next Steps**: The integration is complete and ready for production use. Future enhancements could include refund handling, program access management UI, and sales analytics.
