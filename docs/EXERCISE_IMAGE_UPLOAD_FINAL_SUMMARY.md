## üìã SQL COMMANDS TO RUN IN SUPABASE DASHBOARD

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Execute these commands in order

Copy and paste these commands into **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**:

### **Step 1: Add Image Fields to Exercise Table**
```sql
-- Add image fields to Exercise table
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "imageUrl" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "imageType" TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN "Exercise"."imageUrl" IS 'Public URL of the exercise image/GIF from Supabase Storage';
COMMENT ON COLUMN "Exercise"."imageType" IS 'MIME type of the image (e.g., image/jpeg, image/gif)';
```

### **Step 2: Create Storage Bucket**
```sql
-- Create the 'exercise-images' storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'exercise-images',
  'exercise-images',
  true,
  10485760,
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET
  name = EXCLUDED.name,
  public = EXCLUDED.public,
  file_size_limit = EXCLUDED.file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types = EXCLUDED.allowed_mime_types;
```

### **Step 3: Create RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Policy 1: Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for exercise images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'exercise-images');

-- Policy 2: Admin upload access
CREATE POLICY "Admin upload access for exercise images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'exercise-images' 
  AND auth.uid()::text IN (
    SELECT id FROM "User" WHERE role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Policy 3: Admin update access
CREATE POLICY "Admin update access for exercise images"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'exercise-images'
  AND auth.uid()::text IN (
    SELECT id FROM "User" WHERE role = 'admin'
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'exercise-images'
  AND auth.uid()::text IN (
    SELECT id FROM "User" WHERE role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Policy 4: Admin delete access
CREATE POLICY "Admin delete access for exercise images"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'exercise-images'
  AND auth.uid()::text IN (
    SELECT id FROM "User" WHERE role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

### **Step 4: Verify Setup (Optional)**
```sql
-- Verify bucket was created
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'exercise-images';

-- Verify policies were created
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'objects' 
AND policyname LIKE '%exercise images%';
```
