# Build Issues Fixed - October 9, 2025

## Issue
After reorganizing the repository and moving scripts to the `scripts/` directory, the build failed with:

```
Type error: Cannot find module './src/lib/text-chunking.js' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## Root Cause
The `reprocess-knowledge-base.ts` file was moved from root to `scripts/` directory, but its import paths still referenced `./src/lib/...` which worked when the file was in root but broke when moved to `scripts/`.

## Solution
Updated import paths in `scripts/reprocess-knowledge-base.ts` from:
```typescript
import { chunkText } from './src/lib/text-chunking.js';
import { generateQueryEmbedding } from './src/lib/vector-embeddings.js';
```

To:
```typescript
import { chunkText } from '../src/lib/text-chunking.js';
import { generateQueryEmbedding } from '../src/lib/vector-embeddings.js';
```

## Result
✅ **Build successful** - All pages compiled without errors  
✅ **59 routes** generated successfully  
✅ Only warnings remaining (non-blocking image optimization warnings)

## Build Output Summary
- ✓ Linting and type checking passed
- ✓ 59 static pages generated
- ✓ Build traces collected
- ✓ Page optimization complete
- ⚠️ Minor warnings about `<img>` tags (can be optimized later with Next.js Image component)

## Files Modified
- `scripts/reprocess-knowledge-base.ts` - Updated import paths to use `../src/lib/` instead of `./src/lib/`

## Notes
- The reorganization is complete and functional
- All build processes work correctly
- Scripts can now be run from their new location in `scripts/` directory
- No breaking changes to production functionality

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Build working successfully after repository reorganization
