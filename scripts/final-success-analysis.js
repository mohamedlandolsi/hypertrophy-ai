Okay, here's a complete, evidence-based leg workout designed for hypertrophy, incorporating exercise selection, rep ranges, sets, and rest periods, all based on your knowledge base:

**Workout Focus:** Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth)

**Exercises:**

1.  **Squat Pattern:** Leg Press
    *   **Sets:** 3-4 (KB: Training Volume Guide)
    *   **Reps:** 5-10 (KB: Training Goals Guide, Optimal Repetition Ranges)
    *   **Rest:** 3-5 minutes (KB: Rest Periods Guide)
    *   **Rationale:** Leg press is a stable machine to effectively target the quads. (KB: Lower Body Structure Guide)

2.  **Hip Hinge Pattern:** Romanian Deadlifts
    *   **Sets:** 3-4 (KB: Training Volume Guide)
    *   **Reps:** 5-10 (KB: Training Goals Guide, Optimal Repetition Ranges)
    *   **Rest:** 3-5 minutes (KB: Rest Periods Guide)
    *   **Rationale:** Targets the posterior chain, including glutes and hamstrings. (KB: Lower Body Structure Guide)

3.  **Quadriceps Isolation:** Leg Extensions
    *   **Sets:** 3-4 (KB: Training Volume Guide)
    *   **Reps:** 5-10 (KB: Training Goals Guide, Optimal Repetition Ranges)
    *   **Rest:** 2-5 minutes (KB: Rest Periods Guide)
    *   **Rationale:** Isolates the quadriceps for complete development. (KB: Lower Body Structure Guide)

4.  **Knee Flexion:** Seated Leg Curls
    *   **Sets:** 3-4 (KB: Training Volume Guide)
    *   **Reps:** 5-10 (KB: Training Goals Guide, Optimal Repetition Ranges)
    *   **Rest:** 2-5 minutes (KB: Rest Periods Guide)
    *   **Rationale:** Targets the hamstrings for knee flexion. The seated variation is optimal. (KB: Lower Body Structure Guide)

5.  **Glute Focused:** Hip Thrusts
    *   **Sets:** 3-4 (KB: Training Volume Guide)
    *   **Reps:** 5-10 (KB: Training Goals Guide, Optimal Repetition Ranges)
    *   **Rest:** 2-5 minutes (KB: Rest Periods Guide)
    *   **Rationale:** Directly targets the glutes for maximum growth. (KB: Lower Body Structure Guide)

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Effort:** Take each set close to failure (0-2 RIR) to maximize muscle fiber recruitment. (KB: Training Goals Guide)
*   **Form:** Maintain perfect form throughout the entire range of motion for each exercise. (KB: Training Goals Guide)
*   **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight or resistance over time to continue stimulating muscle growth.
*   **Rest:** Adjust rest periods based on your personal recovery capacity. (KB: Rest Periods Guide)

This workout provides a complete and balanced approach to lower body hypertrophy, incorporating key movement patterns and isolation exercises with evidence-based parameters for sets, reps, and rest.
