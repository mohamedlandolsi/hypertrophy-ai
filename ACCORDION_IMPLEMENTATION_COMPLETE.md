# Accordion Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully replaced the custom accordion in the `ArticleLinks` component with a proper Radix UI/shadcn accordion component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Radix UI Accordion
- Added `@radix-ui/react-accordion` package to dependencies

### 2. Created Accordion UI Component
- Created `src/components/ui/accordion.tsx` following shadcn/ui patterns
- Includes proper TypeScript types and accessibility features
- Uses `AccordionPrimitive` components from Radix UI

### 3. Updated Tailwind Config
- Added accordion animations to `tailwind.config.ts`:
  - `accordion-down`: Smooth expand animation
  - `accordion-up`: Smooth collapse animation
  - Uses CSS custom properties for dynamic height calculation

### 4. Updated ArticleLinks Component
- Replaced custom accordion implementation with Radix UI accordion
- Maintained the same visual styling and behavior
- Removed manual state management (useState) 
- Removed custom chevron icons (now handled by AccordionTrigger)
- Preserved all existing styling for user/assistant message roles

## Key Features
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Smooth Animations**: Native Radix UI animations with proper height transitions
- **Collapsible by Default**: Articles are collapsed initially as requested
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintains the existing chat message styling
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with proper component props

## Component Structure
```tsx
<Accordion type="single" collapsible>
  <AccordionItem value="referenced-articles">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      <FileText /> Referenced Articles ({count})
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      {/* Article links */}
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Benefits Over Custom Implementation
1. **Better Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
2. **Proper Animations**: Smooth height transitions using CSS custom properties
3. **Maintained State**: No manual state management needed
4. **Industry Standard**: Uses proven Radix UI primitives
5. **Consistent API**: Follows shadcn/ui patterns used elsewhere in the project

The accordion now provides a professional, accessible, and smooth user experience for viewing referenced articles in chat messages.
