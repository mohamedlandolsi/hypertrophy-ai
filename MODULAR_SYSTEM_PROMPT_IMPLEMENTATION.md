# Modular System Prompt Implementation Complete

## Overview

The system prompt has been successfully modularized into smaller, manageable components that can be dynamically assembled based on the user's query intent and retrieved context.

## Key Components

### 1. Base Components
- **`getBasePersona()`**: Core AI persona and identity
- **`getCoreResponseProtocol()`**: Universal response guidelines
- **`getFallbackProtocol()`**: Handling of insufficient knowledge context

### 2. Task-Specific Components
- **`getQuestionAnsweringGuidelines()`**: General Q&A responses
- **`getWorkoutProgramGuidelines()`**: Workout program creation
- **`getProgramReviewGuidelines()`**: Program analysis and feedback
- **`getNutritionGuidelines()`**: Nutrition and supplementation advice

### 3. Context Integration
- **`getUserProfileSection()`**: User profile integration
- **`getExerciseValidationSection()`**: Exercise validation context

## Dynamic Assembly

### Intent Detection
The `detectPromptIntent()` function analyzes user queries to determine:
- **isWorkoutProgram**: Program creation requests
- **isProgramReview**: Program analysis requests  
- **isNutritionFocused**: Nutrition/supplement questions
- **isGeneralQA**: General fitness questions

### Prompt Assembly
The `getDynamicSystemPrompt()` function:
1. Starts with base persona and core protocol
2. Adds task-specific guidelines based on detected intent
3. Includes fallback protocol and user profile
4. Appends exercise validation context

## Implementation Details

### Chat API Integration
- **Updated Route**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- **Dynamic Generation**: System prompt generated after knowledge retrieval
- **Context Aware**: Uses query content and retrieved knowledge for optimal assembly

### Workout Program Generator
- **Updated**: `src/lib/ai/workout-program-generator.ts`
- **Enhanced Context**: Uses knowledge context in prompt generation
- **Specialized Focus**: Automatically includes workout-specific guidelines

## Benefits

### 1. Modularity
- Individual components can be updated independently
- Easy to add new task-specific guidelines
- Better maintainability and testing

### 2. Context Awareness
- Prompts adapt to user query type
- Only relevant guidelines are included
- More focused and efficient prompts

### 3. Performance
- Smaller, more targeted prompts
- Reduced token usage for irrelevant content
- Faster processing and better AI responses

### 4. Flexibility
- Easy to extend for new use cases
- Simple to A/B test different prompt components
- Customizable based on user profiles and contexts

## Usage Examples

### Workout Program Request
```
Query: "Create a 4-day upper/lower split"
Intent: isWorkoutProgram = true
Includes: Base + Core + WorkoutProgram + Fallback + Profile + Exercises
```

### Program Review Request
```
Query: "Review my current routine"
Intent: isProgramReview = true
Includes: Base + Core + ProgramReview + Fallback + Profile + Exercises
```

### Nutrition Question
```
Query: "What supplements for muscle growth?"
Intent: isNutritionFocused = true
Includes: Base + Core + Nutrition + GeneralQA + Fallback + Profile + Exercises
```

### General Fitness Question
```
Query: "How many sets for biceps?"
Intent: isGeneralQA = true
Includes: Base + Core + GeneralQA + Fallback + Profile + Exercises
```

## Backward Compatibility

The original `getSystemPrompt()` function is preserved for backward compatibility and now calls the new `getDynamicSystemPrompt()` function internally.

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ✅ Build compilation
- ✅ TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Integration with existing chat and workout generation flows
- ✅ Intent detection accuracy
- ✅ Dynamic prompt assembly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Analytics**: Track which prompt components are most effective
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare different versions of prompt components
3. **User Feedback**: Adapt prompts based on user satisfaction
4. **Advanced Intent**: More granular intent detection (e.g., specific muscle groups)
5. **Personalization**: Learn user preferences over time

The modular system prompt implementation provides a robust, flexible foundation for delivering contextually appropriate AI responses while maintaining code organization and extensibility.
