Training for muscle hypertrophy depends on 3 key factors:
- High Intensity: Take every working set to failure or close to failure with 0-2 repetitions in reserve.
- High Frequency: Train each muscle 2 to 3 times a week or every 48 to 72 hours.
- Training Volume that suits you: Find the number of sets for each muscle that you can recover from between training sessions. A general recommendation is 4-10 sets per week for each muscle spread across 2 or 3 training sessions. Another recommendation: if you train a muscle every 48 hours for example a full body split then 1-3 sets each session, if you train a muscle every 72 hours for example an upper lower split then 2-4 sets each session. But, not all muscles have the same recovery rate, some muscles recover faster than other muscles, calves, quadriceps, trapezius, rear delts, glutes, abs, wrist flexors and extensors tend to have fast recovery time while muscles like chest, biceps, triceps, brachioradialis and hamstrings have the slowest recovery time so they need less volume.
