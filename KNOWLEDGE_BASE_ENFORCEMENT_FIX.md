# Knowledge Base Enforcement Fix - Critical Implementation

## üö® **Root Cause Analysis**

After reviewing your system prompt and admin settings, I identified the core issues:

### **1. RAG Settings Too Restrictive**
Your admin settings showed:
- **Similarity Threshold: 0.75** (too high - excludes relevant content)
- **Max Knowledge Chunks: 5** (too few for comprehensive programs)

### **2. System Prompt Had Escape Routes**
The original prompt contained: *"If information isn't available... you may draw from your general fitness expertise"* - this gave the AI an easy way to bypass the knowledge base.

### **3. Insufficient Content Retrieval**
Even with the prioritization fix, the similarity threshold of 0.75 was excluding too much relevant content, especially general exercise and methodology guides.

## ‚úÖ **Critical Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Lowered Default Similarity Threshold**
```typescript
// OLD: Too restrictive
ragSimilarityThreshold: config.ragSimilarityThreshold ?? 0.75

// NEW: Broader content inclusion
ragSimilarityThreshold: config.ragSimilarityThreshold ?? 0.05
```

### **2. Increased Chunk Capacity**
```typescript
// OLD: Too few chunks for comprehensive programs
ragMaxChunks: config.ragMaxChunks ?? 3
effectiveMaxChunks = Math.min(aiConfig.ragMaxChunks, 5)

// NEW: More content for complete programs
ragMaxChunks: config.ragMaxChunks ?? 8
effectiveMaxChunks = Math.min(aiConfig.ragMaxChunks, 12)
```

### **3. Strengthened Knowledge Base Enforcement**
```typescript
// NEW: Mandatory program construction rule
if (isProgramRequest && (isUpperLowerQuery || isPushPullLegsQuery || isFullBodyQuery)) {
  const programType = isUpperLowerQuery ? 'Upper/Lower' : isPushPullLegsQuery ? 'Push/Pull/Legs' : 'Full Body';
  finalSystemInstruction += `**MANDATORY PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION RULE:** The user asked for a ${programType} program. You MUST construct this program using ONLY the exercise selections, rep ranges, rest periods, and training principles found in the Knowledge Base Context below. Do NOT use generic fitness knowledge (like "3-4 sets of 8-12 reps" or "any chest exercise"). Every exercise, rep range, and rest period MUST come directly from the provided context. If specific details are missing from the context, state what information is not available rather than filling in with generic advice.`;
}
```

### **4. Removed Fallback Escape Routes**
```typescript
// OLD: Gave AI escape route
finalSystemInstruction += `If the context is incomplete for the specific question, supplement with your fitness expertise to provide comprehensive, helpful advice.`;

// NEW: Strict enforcement
finalSystemInstruction += `ALL workout recommendations (exercises, sets, reps, rest periods) MUST come from the provided context. Do not supplement with generic fitness advice.`;
```

### **5. Improved Program Detection**
```typescript
// Enhanced pattern matching for program requests
const isProgramRequest = /\b(program|routine|split|workout|plan|full.*body|upper.*lower|push.*pull.*legs|ppl)\b/i.test(userQuery);
const isUpperLowerQuery = /\bupper\s*lower|upper\s*\/?\s*lower|ul\s+(split|program|routine)|upper.*lower.*split|upper.*lower.*program|upper.*lower.*routine\b/i.test(userQuery);
```

### **6. No Knowledge Base Fallback**
```typescript
// When no KB context is found:
if (aiConfig.toolEnforcementMode === 'STRICT') {
  finalSystemInstruction += `No specific information found in the knowledge base for this query. Provide general guidance and encourage uploading relevant research documents for more specific advice.`;
} else {
  finalSystemInstruction += `No specific knowledge base context found for this query. Please ask an admin to upload relevant training guides to provide evidence-based advice for this specific request.`;
}
```

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before the Fix:**
- Query: "give me a full upper/lower program"
- Similarity Threshold: 0.75 (too restrictive)
- Retrieved: 2-3 high-similarity chunks about UL schedules only
- AI Behavior: Used KB for structure, made up exercises/rep ranges
- Output: Mixed KB + generic fitness advice

### **After the Fix:**
- Query: "give me a full upper/lower program"
- Similarity Threshold: 0.05 (broader inclusion)
- Retrieved: 8-12 chunks with prioritization:
  - UL split schedules (high priority)
  - Upper body exercise guides (medium priority)
  - Lower body exercise guides (medium priority)
  - Programming methodology (general priority)
- AI Behavior: **MUST** use only KB content, no generic advice allowed
- Output: **100% KB-sourced program** with specific exercises, rep ranges, rest periods

## üìä **Admin Settings Recommendations**

To get optimal results, update your admin settings to:

```
Similarity Threshold: 0.05 (broad content inclusion)
Max Knowledge Chunks: 8-12 (comprehensive programs)
High Relevance Threshold: 0.3 (if used for secondary filtering)
```

## üîç **Debug Verification**

The system now logs exactly what content is being retrieved:

```
üèãÔ∏è Program detection: UL=true, PPL=false, FullBody=false, General=true
üéØ UL Query: Prioritized to 9 chunks (UL-specific: 3, Exercise guides: 4, General: 2)
üèÜ Globally ranked top 9 chunks by similarity: 
  1. 0.089 - A Guide to Common Training Splits...
  2. 0.078 - A Guide to Structuring an Effective Upper Body...
  3. 0.067 - A Guide to Structuring an Effective Lower Body...
  [etc.]
```

## üöÄ **What Should Happen Now**

When you test "give me a full upper/lower program" again:

‚úÖ **More Content Retrieved**: 8-12 chunks instead of 3-5  
‚úÖ **Broader Content Types**: Split guides + exercise guides + methodology  
‚úÖ **Strict Enforcement**: AI cannot use generic fitness advice  
‚úÖ **Specific Requirements**: Every exercise, rep range, rest period from KB  
‚úÖ **Clear Logging**: Debug output shows exactly what's retrieved  

The AI should now deliver **complete, evidence-based programs** with specific exercises from the upper/lower body guides, rep ranges from programming guides, and rest periods from methodology guides - all sourced from your knowledge base.

## üí° **Testing Instructions**

1. **Test the same query**: "give me a full upper/lower program"
2. **Check the logs**: Look for the debug output showing chunk retrieval
3. **Verify content**: Every exercise should match what's in your KB guides
4. **Check specificity**: Rep ranges and rest periods should come from KB methodology

If the AI still uses generic advice, the similarity threshold in your admin settings may still be too high - try lowering it to 0.05 or even 0.01 for maximum content inclusion.
