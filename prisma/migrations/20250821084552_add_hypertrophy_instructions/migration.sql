When generating workout programs for hypertrophy (muscle building), follow these specific guidelines:

## Program Structure
- Design programs with 3-6 training days per week
- Focus on compound movements first, isolation exercises second
- Include adequate volume (10-20 sets per muscle group per week)
- Implement progressive overload principles

## Exercise Selection
- Prioritize compound exercises: squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows
- Include isolation exercises for targeted muscle development
- Consider user''s equipment availability and experience level
- Ensure balanced muscle development (push/pull ratios)

## Sets, Reps, and Load
- Hypertrophy rep range: 6-20 reps per set
- Moderate to high intensity: 65-85% 1RM
- Rest periods: 2-4 minutes for compound exercises, 1-3 minutes for isolation
- Volume progression over time

## Program Periodization
- Start with moderate volume and intensity
- Implement deload weeks every 4-6 weeks
- Progress complexity based on user experience
- Allow for individual recovery needs

## Safety and Adaptations
- Always consider user''s injury history and limitations
- Provide exercise modifications when needed
- Emphasize proper form over heavy weight
- Include warm-up and cool-down protocols';
