# Chat Input Handler Bug Fix

## Issue
The chat application was throwing an error when sending a second message: "customHandleInputChange is not defined" error appearing in the browser console.

## Root Cause
1. The `ArabicAwareTextarea` component was referencing `customHandleInputChange` but the function was defined but not being used consistently
2. The `sendMessage` useCallback was missing the `isLoading` dependency, causing React Hook exhaustive deps warnings
3. There were two input change handlers - `handleInputChange` and `customHandleInputChange` - causing confusion

## Solution
1. **Fixed undefined reference**: Updated the textarea to use `customHandleInputChange` which includes character limit validation (2000 chars)
2. **Fixed useCallback dependencies**: Added `isLoading` to the dependency array of the `sendMessage` callback
3. **Consistent handler usage**: Ensured `customHandleInputChange` is used in the textarea for proper character limit enforcement

## Changes Made
- `src/app/[locale]/chat/page.tsx`:
  - Updated `ArabicAwareTextarea` onChange to use `customHandleInputChange`
  - Added `isLoading` to the `sendMessage` useCallback dependencies
  - This ensures the input properly enforces the 2000 character limit while maintaining all functionality

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes without TypeScript/ESLint errors
- ✅ Input handler properly defined and used
- ✅ Character limit enforcement works correctly
- ✅ React Hook dependencies are complete

## Impact
- Chat input now works reliably for multiple messages
- Character limit is properly enforced (2000 characters)
- No more undefined function errors
- Proper React Hook optimization with complete dependencies

The chat application is now fully functional and ready for production use.
