A general \nrecommendation is 410 sets per week for each muscle spread across 2 \nor 3 training sessions. Another recommendation: if you train a muscle \nevery 48 hours for example a full body split then 13 sets each session, \nif you train a muscle every 72 hours for example an upper lower split \nthen 24 sets each session. But, not all muscles have the same recovery \nrate, some muscles recover faster than other muscles, calves, \nquadriceps, trapezius, rear delts, glutes, abs, wrist flexors and extensors \ntend to have fast recovery time while muscles like chest, biceps, triceps, \nbrachioradialis and hamstrings have the slowest recovery time so they \nneed less volume.\nRIR R   epetitions in Reserve, that means how many repetitions you leave in a \nset before hitting failure. For example if you stop your set while you still have \n1 more repetition that you can perform thatʼs 1 RIR, if you stop the set while \nyou will fail in the next rep thatʼs  0 RIR.\nFailure: Reaching failure means not being able to perform another rep with \ngood form and the needed range of motion for the exercise.\nMuscles have only two states, either they are growing or they are atrophying \n(loosing muscle), studies show that muscle growth duration after training \nthem lasts for about 48 hours 2 days) then they start atrophying, thatʼs why \ntraining with high frequency is crucial.\nStudies show that there is no significant difference between reaching failure \nleaving 03 RIR, the last reps in a set are the most fatiguing and damaging, \nso if you leave repetitions in reserve you would fatigue your CNS less thus \nyouʼd have more productive sets for the rest of your session.\nInfo for Hypertrophy AI1\n\nIf you are in your letʼs say 2 first years of lifting, itʼs better to train to failure \nso you get used to it and learn how it feels exactly, once you learned that \nyou can start training with RIR. Because you are more like not able to gauge \nyour RIR correctly if you are a beginner.\nSplit Programming\nTraining 34 times a week is the sweet spot providing good amount of rest \ndays.\nGood training splits options: Full body 3 times a week, Full Body EOD Every \nother day), Upper/Lower 4 times a week, Upper/Lower 2 days on 1 day off, \nAnterior/Posterior 4 times a week or 2 days on 1 day off, Upper/Lower x Full \nBody etc..\nYou can be flexible with training splits but keep in mind to adjust it based on \nrecovery and frequency.\nMuscle recovery differs from a person to other but a general \nrecommendation is doing 410 sets a week per muscle. If you train a muscle \nevery 48 hours like in full body split then 13 sets per muscle per session, if \nyou train a muscle every 72 hours like in upper/lower split then 24 sets per \nmuscle per session.\nRecovery rate is not the same between muscles, muscles that recover the \nfastest such as quadriceps, calves, rear delts, trapezius, glutes, erector \nspinae, abs, wrist flexors/extensors, adductors and muscles that recover the \nslowest such as chest, biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, hamstrings, front \ndelts and muscles that have mid recovery rates such as side delts and lats.\nHow can you know if your muscle is getting enough recovery between \nsessions?\nThe key factor to measure muscle growth is by progressive overload which \nis increasing in weight or reps or even form across your sessions. For a \nbeginner progressive overload can occur each session and as you get used \nto it it becomes slower and can take weeks to add a rep in an exercise. If \nyour progress stall for a long period of time 34 weeks+ then it can be \nbecause that muscle is not recovering between sessions and you should \nrevise your programming reduce number of sets, train with RIR or change \nexercise if needed or even training style affect your recovery ability. Using \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI2\n\nintensifiers such as dropsets, supersets etc.. will lead to more  muscle \ndamage thus longer recovery time and they donʼt provide any extra benefit \nfor hypertrophy, also very slow eccentrics, always reaching failure, high \nreps affect recovery so you should review your training style.\nChest Training\nThe chest muscle (pectoralis major) has 3 regions, upper chest (clavicular), \nmiddle chest (sternal) and lower chest (costal). The main functions of chest \nare horizontal adduction (for the entire chest and especially the middle \nregion), shoulder flexion (upper region) and shoulder adduction (middle and \nlower regions). \nFor the horizontal adduction, it has best relative leverage in the beginning of \nthe movement that means a descending resistance profile is preferred in the \nexercise.\nGood exercises to choose from: Chest fly on a machine pec deck, chest \npresses machines, low to high cable fly or front raises seated on a bench for \nbetter stability and using a cuff would be a great idea for less tension on the \nforearms, grip and elbow.\nChest has the slowest recovery rate among all other muscles, that means it \ntakes the longest to recover from usually but this factor also depends on the \nindividualʼs genetics. So, you should structure your chest training volume \n(number of sets) wisely to provide enough recovery between sessions.\nThe chest benefits from stretch mediated hypertrophy, so you can train \nthem in the stretched position but donʼt overdo that or spend a long time in \nthe “deep stretchˮ since that causes too much muscle damage and fatigue \nleading to longer recovery time.\nLats Training\nThe lats muscle has 3 regions, upper lats (thoracic region), middle lats \n(lumbar region), lower lats (iliac region).\nThe main functions of the lats are shoulder extension in the sagittal plane \n(works the entire lats and biases the upper region) and shoulder adduction \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI3\n\nin the frontal plane (works the entire lats and biases the middle to lower \nregions).\nGood exercises to choose from are lat pulldown on cable or machine, pull-\nups, any type of pulldown machine and chest supported row machine with \ntucked elbows. For more optimal exercises you can do keenan flaps for \nshoulder adduction or extension (itʼs an exercise done on the cable with cuff \naround the elbow, seated on a bench for stability and itʼs unilateral exercise).\nThe lats donʼt benefit from stretch mediated hypertrophy as itʼs commonly \nbelieved among people, they even lose leverage in the stretched position.\nUpper Back Training\nThe upper back has trapezius and rhomboids muscles and posterior \ndeltoids.\nThe main function of trapezius and rhomboids is scapula retraction and for \nposterior deltoids is shoulder horizontal abduction and shoulder extension \n(especially when the arm is above shoulder height).\nGood exercises to choose from are a chest supported row machine or a \nchest supported T-bar row with an arm angle at around 60 to 90 degrees, \nthis exercise will train all of the upper back muscles. If you want to do \nisolation exercises, you can do chest supported kelso shrugs for the \ntrapezius and rhomboids and reverse fly on a machine or cable for the \nposterior deltoids.\nNote: Upper back muscles does not benefit from stretch mediated \nhypertrophy and they tend to recover pretty fast compared to other \nmuscles.\nShoulders Training\nThe shoulders have 3 main regions: anterior or front deltoid, middle or side \ndeltoid and posterior or rear deltoid.\nThe main functions of the anterior deltoid are shoulder flexion with best \nleverage between 0° and 20° of shoulder flexion (at the beginning of the \nmovement) and shoulder abduction with best leverage above shoulder \nheight (above 90° of shoulder abduction) (at the end of the movement).\nThe main function of the middle deltoid is shoulder abduction between 0° \nand 90° of shoulder abduction.\nInfo for Hypertrophy AI4\n\nThe main functions of posterior deltoid are horizontal shoulder abduction \nand shoulder extension, it has good leverage in the entire range of motion \nfor both movements.\nGood exercises to choose from are: Any type of lateral raises for the middle \ndeltoids, can be with dumbbells or with cable or a machine but the best \nvariations are the stable ones and the ones with less extra loads on joints \nand other muscles so if you want to be more optimal with your lateral raises \nyou can use a stable machine or cables with cuffs around your elbows. A \nshoulder press variation for anterior and middle deltoids also you can use a \ngood machine or smith machine for more stability. Reverse fly on a machine \nor cables for the posterior deltoids. Front raises hardest at the beginning of \nthe movement (descending resistance profile) for better focus on the \nanterior deltoids and also it would be better cuffed.\nNote: The posterior deltoids get trained well in back exercises, that means \nitʼ s fine if you donʼt train them directly.\nGlutes Training\nGlutes have 3 regions: gluteus maximus which is the biggest region and itʼs \nsplit into upper and lower regions, gluteus medius and gluteus minimus.\nThe main functions are hip extension (for gluteus maximus and especially \nthe lower part), hip abduction for the upper part of the gluteus maximus, \ngluteus medius and minimus and also there is a contribution in external and \ninternal hip rotation.\nThe best leverage in hip extension is when the hip is fully extended \n(contracted).\nThe best exercise choice is hip thrust + hip abduction on a machine or \ncable.\nOther exercises that you can do are: Kickback using cable or machine, \nbanded hyperextension, squat patterns or leg press, split squat patterns and \nromanian deadlifts.\nNote: Glutes have fast recovery rate.\nQuadriceps Training\nInfo for Hypertrophy AI5\n\nThe quadriceps is a muscle in the anterior of the thighs that has 4 heads \n(rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis). \nThe rectus femoris is a two joints muscle (hip and knee) while the vastus \nmuscles are single joint muscles (knee only).\nThe main function of quadriceps is knee extension.\nThe best exercise to work the entire quadriceps is leg extension and add a \nsquat or leg press pattern for a balanced regional hypertrophy. Squats and \nleg presses only train the vastus heads and does not train the rectus \nfemoris. The best squat variations for quadriceps are pendulum squat or \nhack squat because they focus on knee extension and they are stable.\nResistance profile in leg extension is not important because quadriceps are \nthe only knee extensors but you can focus on rectus femoris and vastus \nmedialis with an ascending resistance profile and a descending resistance \nprofile for more focus on vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius. For a squat \nor leg press exercise an ascending or bell-shaped resistance profile \nmatches the quadriceps best relative leverage.\nQuadriceps are usually one of the fastest muscle in recovery time due to low \nlevels of voluntary activation, so you can give them more volume (number of \nsets) and train them more frequently.\nForearms Training\nForearms are complex muscle group that are mainly divided into posterior \nand anterior parts.\nThe functions of the forearms are: \nDebunking Myths\nIntensifiers like drop set, cluster set, giant set, superset, finisher are not \nbeneficial for hypertrophy because they add unnecessary fatigue and \nmuscle damage that will have a negative effect on muscle growth. \nFatigue will make your next sets during the session less effective and \nmuscle damage will impact recovery time of the muscle thus making you \nhaving hard time to train with high frequency. To have a beneficial \nworking set for muscle hypertrophy, itʼ s really simple, just use a weight \nthat you can achieve between 5 and 10 repetitions with good technique \nand reach failure or get close to failure 0  2 RIR. The idea of going \nbeyond failure is false because you already reached your maximum \nmotor unit recruitment when getting close to failure that means you \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI6\n\nreached your maximum hypertrophy stimulus. There are a lot of studies \nthat proved that drop sets donʼt add anything to muscle growth PMIDs: \n37523092, 34260860, 28532248, 28130627, 34564324.\nMetabolic stress does not contribute to muscle growth. Sarcoplasmic \nhypertrophy is temporary and does not equate to real hypertrophy which \nis myofibrillar hypertrophy. The idea its contribution to hypertrophy is old\nand debunked.\nFree weights are not superior to machines and cables for muscle \nhypertrophy because free weights exercises usually require using other \nmuscles for stability and controlling the weights and this reduces the \nmotor unit recruitment. Also free weights require getting used to the \nexercise. Also machines are usually more safe. While machines usually \nprovide better stability and are easier especially for beginners that need \nto learn proper forms. Some machines are have flaws, so it depends. For \nexample a barbell row exercise requires using a lot of core and lower \nbody muscles for stability while a great alternative like a chest \nsupported row machine provides the best stability for better stimulus to \nthe targeted muscle. Also there is another key factor when choosing an \nexercise which is enjoyment and preference, when you choose an \nexercise that you love and enjoy you would be more motivated to \nperform better, put more efforts and this will make the mechanical \ntension higher. Also another important thing to mention which is \nchoosing an exercise with a resistance profile matching the best relative \nleverage of the muscle. Also there is a myth that says that stabilizer \nmuscles get stimulated in free weight unstable exercises and not in \nmachines and thatʼs wrong, they get stimulated either way while \nperforming the same movement. \nProgressive overload isnʼt responsible for muscle growth, it is the result \nof hypertrophy. When you see progress that means your muscle is \nactually growing.\nMuscle damage does not contribute to hypertrophy, itʼ s a result of \nphysical activities. Muscle damage has negative effects on muscle \ngrowth such as longer recovery times.\nTime under tension is not beneficial for hypertrophy, you donʼt need to \nslow your movement while doing an exercise. The unvoluntary slow in \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI7\n\nthe concentric phase when getting closer to failure is the key to measure \nmechanical tension.\nMind-Muscle Connection does not benefit hypertrophy, what matters \nmore is the external focus.\nSmall muscles do not need lighter weight and more repetitions. All \nmuscles work the same way, they need high load and getting to or close \nto failure.\nShoulders and triceps are not small muscles, they are the biggest \nmuscles in the upper body.\nBig muscles like leg muscles are not necessarily slow in recovery.\nSmall muscles like biceps do not recover quickly.\nFiber type distribution have nothing to do with number of reps for that \nspecific muscle.\nNot all muscles benefit from stretch mediated hypertrophy.\nYou donʼt need to do full range of motion in every exercise. Itʼ s better to \nwork in the ROM where the muscle has leverage.\nYou should never fatigue your muscles.\nPump does not matter for muscle growth.\nYou canʼt bias the long head or short head of the biceps.\nYou donʼt need deloads. If you have a good programming with a good \nfatigue management then you would never need a deload.\nBro split is not a good program.\nThere are no specific repetitions range for hypertrophy, itʼ s all about \nreaching or getting close to failure but low rep range such as 510 is the \nbest to minimize fatigue and muscle damage.\nYou donʼt need to bulk to gain muscles. A maintenance or small surplus \n10% of your maintenance calories max) is enough.\nYou should rest enough between sets between 2 and 5 minutes \ndepending on the exercise and fatigue.\nInfo for Hypertrophy AI8\n\n=== Instructions ===\nUse the information from each muscle training guide to build workout programs and sessions and ensure that you follow the guide from training basics and split programming.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTEXT USAGE:\n1.

The best squat variations for quadriceps are pendulum squat or \nhack squat because they focus on knee extension and they are stable.\nResistance profile in leg extension is not important because quadriceps are \nthe only knee extensors but you can focus on rectus femoris and vastus \nmedialis with an ascending resistance profile and a descending resistance \nprofile for more focus on vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius. For a squat \nor leg press exercise an ascending or bell-shaped resistance profile \nmatches the quadriceps best relative leverage.\nQuadriceps are usually one of the fastest muscle in recovery time due to low \nlevels of voluntary activation, so you can give them more volume (number of \nsets) and train them more frequently.\nForearms Training\nForearms are complex muscle group that are mainly divided into posterior \nand anterior parts.\nThe functions of the forearms are: \nDebunking Myths\nIntensifiers like drop set, cluster set, giant set, superset, finisher are not \nbeneficial for hypertrophy because they add unnecessary fatigue and \nmuscle damage that will have a negative effect on muscle growth. \nFatigue will make your next sets during the session less effective and \nmuscle damage will impact recovery time of the muscle thus making you \nhaving hard time to train with high frequency. To have a beneficial \nworking set for muscle hypertrophy, itʼ s really simple, just use a weight \nthat you can achieve between 5 and 10 repetitions with good technique \nand reach failure or get close to failure 0  2 RIR. The idea of going \nbeyond failure is false because you already reached your maximum \nmotor unit recruitment when getting close to failure that means you \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI6\n\nreached your maximum hypertrophy stimulus. There are a lot of studies \nthat proved that drop sets donʼt add anything to muscle growth PMIDs: \n37523092, 34260860, 28532248, 28130627, 34564324.\nMetabolic stress does not contribute to muscle growth. Sarcoplasmic \nhypertrophy is temporary and does not equate to real hypertrophy which \nis myofibrillar hypertrophy. The idea its contribution to hypertrophy is old\nand debunked.\nFree weights are not superior to machines and cables for muscle \nhypertrophy because free weights exercises usually require using other \nmuscles for stability and controlling the weights and this reduces the \nmotor unit recruitment. Also free weights require getting used to the \nexercise. Also machines are usually more safe. While machines usually \nprovide better stability and are easier especially for beginners that need \nto learn proper forms. Some machines are have flaws, so it depends. For \nexample a barbell row exercise requires using a lot of core and lower \nbody muscles for stability while a great alternative like a chest \nsupported row machine provides the best stability for better stimulus to \nthe targeted muscle. Also there is another key factor when choosing an \nexercise which is enjoyment and preference, when you choose an \nexercise that you love and enjoy you would be more motivated to \nperform better, put more efforts and this will make the mechanical \ntension higher. Also another important thing to mention which is \nchoosing an exercise with a resistance profile matching the best relative \nleverage of the muscle. Also there is a myth that says that stabilizer \nmuscles get stimulated in free weight unstable exercises and not in \nmachines and thatʼs wrong, they get stimulated either way while \nperforming the same movement. \nProgressive overload isnʼt responsible for muscle growth, it is the result \nof hypertrophy. When you see progress that means your muscle is \nactually growing.\nMuscle damage does not contribute to hypertrophy, itʼ s a result of \nphysical activities. Muscle damage has negative effects on muscle \ngrowth such as longer recovery times.\nTime under tension is not beneficial for hypertrophy, you donʼt need to \nslow your movement while doing an exercise. The unvoluntary slow in \nInfo for Hypertrophy AI7\n\nthe concentric phase when getting closer to failure is the key to measure \nmechanical tension.\nMind-Muscle Connection does not benefit hypertrophy, what matters \nmore is the external focus.\nSmall muscles do not need lighter weight and more repetitions. All \nmuscles work the same way, they need high load and getting to or close \nto failure.\nShoulders and triceps are not small muscles, they are the biggest \nmuscles in the upper body.\nBig muscles like leg muscles are not necessarily slow in recovery.\nSmall muscles like biceps do not recover quickly.\nFiber type distribution have nothing to do with number of reps for that \nspecific muscle.\nNot all muscles benefit from stretch mediated hypertrophy.\nYou donʼt need to do full range of motion in every exercise. Itʼ s better to \nwork in the ROM where the muscle has leverage.\nYou should never fatigue your muscles.\nPump does not matter for muscle growth.\nYou canʼt bias the long head or short head of the biceps.\nYou donʼt need deloads. If you have a good programming with a good \nfatigue management then you would never need a deload.\nBro split is not a good program.\nThere are no specific repetitions range for hypertrophy, itʼ s all about \nreaching or getting close to failure but low rep range such as 510 is the \nbest to minimize fatigue and muscle damage.\nYou donʼt need to bulk to gain muscles. A maintenance or small surplus \n10% of your maintenance calories max) is enough.\nYou should rest enough between sets between 2 and 5 minutes \ndepending on the exercise and fatigue.\nInfo for Hypertrophy AI8\n\n=== Instructions ===\nUse the information from each muscle training guide to build workout programs and sessions and ensure that you follow the guide from training basics and split programming.",
