# Enhanced Message Formatting - RESOLVED âœ…

## ISSUE RESOLUTION
Successfully resolved the PostCSS configuration error and implemented enhanced markdown formatting for AI messages.

## PROBLEM
- Users saw raw markdown symbols (`**bold**`, `*italics*`, etc.) instead of properly formatted text
- PostCSS configuration error with Tailwind CSS v4 and typography plugin compatibility

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

**Resolution**:

- Installed `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` 
- Created custom styled components for all markdown elements
- Preserved Arabic text support and RTL direction
- Added dark mode compatibility
- Maintained responsive design
```
