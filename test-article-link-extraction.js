As an intermediate lifter, you can effectively use the RIR system. The final repetitions in a set are the most fatiguing; by leaving a few repetitions in reserve, you can manage Central Nervous System (CNS) fatigue, which allows for higher quality and effort in subsequent sets [A Guide to Foundational Training Principles](article:cmctdh7kp0001l104txze2div).`;
