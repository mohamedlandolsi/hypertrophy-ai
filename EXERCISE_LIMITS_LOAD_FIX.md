# Exercise Limits Load Fix - Final Solution

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Problem Reported
User reported: "When I update the exercise limit per muscle group and set max number of exercises for each muscle group then save it but when I come back to the edit program page I find the changes I that I have made are not saved there and they are all set as 2"

## Root Cause Analysis

The previous fix (October 5) successfully implemented:
✅ Validation schemas to accept `exercisesPerMuscle`
✅ Database operations to save `exercisesPerMuscle`
✅ Edit page submission to include `exercisesPerMuscle`

However, there was still a **critical missing piece**:

❌ **The edit page was NOT loading `exercisesPerMuscle` from the database back into the form**

### Data Flow Breakdown:

**Working (Save Path):**
1. User sets limits in UI ✅
2. Form updates state ✅
3. handleSaveAndExit includes field ✅
4. API validates field ✅
5. Database saves field ✅

**Broken (Load Path):**
1. Database has saved data ✅
2. API returns data with field ✅
3. loadProgramData receives data ✅
4. **Transform function DROPS the field** ❌
5. Form initialized without field ❌
6. UI shows default value (2) ❌

## The Fix

### Location: `src/app/[locale]/admin/programs/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

### Change 1: Update `loadProgramData` function (lines ~203-210)

**Before:**
```typescript
const transformedWorkoutTemplates = programData.workoutTemplates.map((template, idx) => ({
  id: template.id,
  name: template.name.en || `Workout ${idx + 1}`,
  muscleGroups: template.requiredMuscleGroups,
  // exercisesPerMuscle was NOT included! ❌
  exercises: (template.name as Record<string, unknown>)?._exerciseData as unknown[] || [],
}));
```

**After:**
```typescript
const transformedWorkoutTemplates = programData.workoutTemplates.map((template, idx) => ({
  id: template.id,
  name: template.name.en || `Workout ${idx + 1}`,
  muscleGroups: template.requiredMuscleGroups,
  exercisesPerMuscle: template.exercisesPerMuscle || {}, // ✅ NOW INCLUDED!
  exercises: (template.name as Record<string, unknown>)?._exerciseData as unknown[] || [],
}));
```

### Change 2: Update `TrainingProgramData` interface (lines ~110-116)

**Before:**
```typescript
workoutTemplates: Array<{
  id: string;
  name: Record<string, string>;
  order: number;
  requiredMuscleGroups: string[];
  // exercisesPerMuscle was NOT in type! ❌
}>;
```

**After:**
```typescript
workoutTemplates: Array<{
  id: string;
  name: Record<string, string>;
  order: number;
  requiredMuscleGroups: string[];
  exercisesPerMuscle?: Record<string, number>; // ✅ NOW IN TYPE!
}>;
```

## Complete Data Flow (Now Working)

### Save Flow:
```
User UI
  ↓ (updates form state)
Form State: { exercisesPerMuscle: { chest: 3, back: 4 } }
  ↓ (handleSaveAndExit includes field)
API Payload: { workoutTemplates: [{ exercisesPerMuscle: { chest: 3 } }] }
  ↓ (Zod validation passes)
Database: WorkoutTemplate.exercisesPerMuscle = { "chest": 3, "back": 4 }
```

### Load Flow (NOW FIXED):
```
Database: WorkoutTemplate.exercisesPerMuscle = { "chest": 3, "back": 4 }
  ↓ (API fetches data)
API Response: { workoutTemplates: [{ exercisesPerMuscle: { chest: 3, back: 4 } }] }
  ↓ (loadProgramData NOW includes field)
Form State: { exercisesPerMuscle: { chest: 3, back: 4 } }
  ↓ (form renders)
User UI: Shows Chest: 3, Back: 4 ✅
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/[locale]/admin/programs/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
   - Added `exercisesPerMuscle` to `loadProgramData` transformation
   - Added `exercisesPerMuscle` to `TrainingProgramData.workoutTemplates` interface

## Testing

### Before Fix:
1. Edit program, set Chest: 3, Back: 4
2. Save program ✅
3. Return to edit page
4. **BUG**: All limits show as 2 ❌

### After Fix:
1. Edit program, set Chest: 3, Back: 4
2. Save program ✅
3. Return to edit page
4. **FIXED**: Chest shows 3, Back shows 4 ✅

## Build Results

```
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Build successful
✓ 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Always check both save AND load paths** when implementing persistence
2. **Data transformation functions** are critical points where data can be lost
3. **TypeScript interfaces** help catch these issues, but only if they're complete
4. **Round-trip testing** (save → reload → verify) is essential

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Exercise limits now persist correctly through the full save/load cycle.

User can now:
- Set exercise limits per muscle group
- Save the program
- Return to edit the program
- See their saved limits correctly displayed
