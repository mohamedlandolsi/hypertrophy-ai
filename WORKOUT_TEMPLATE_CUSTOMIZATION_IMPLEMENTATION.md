# Workout Template Customization Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the Program Customizer component with comprehensive workout template modification capabilities, allowing users to select and customize exercises within each workout template according to their training preferences.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Workout Customization Tab

**Enhanced Customization Interface:**
- Added dedicated \"Workouts\" tab in the Program Customizer
- Interactive exercise selection for each workout template
- Real-time feedback and visual indicators
- Category-based exercise recommendations

**User Experience Features:**
- Auto-select functionality for optimal exercise selection
- Clear all exercises option for each workout
- Visual progress indicators and exercise count tracking
- Color-coded feedback based on selection status

### 2. Exercise Selection System

**Smart Exercise Filtering:**
- Exercises filtered by muscle group compatibility
- Primary and secondary muscle group matching
- Equipment-based exercise categorization
- Category-specific exercise limits (Minimalist: 6, Essentialist: 8, Maximalist: 12)

**Selection Logic:**
- Click to select/deselect exercises
- Maximum exercise limits based on training category
- Visual feedback for selected exercises
- Disabled state when maximum reached

### 3. Auto-Selection Algorithm

**Intelligent Exercise Selection:**
- Prioritizes compound movements over isolation exercises
- Sorts exercises by muscle group coverage
- Respects category-specific exercise limits
- Maintains muscle group balance

**Helper Functions:**
```typescript
- getMaxExercisesForCategory(): Returns max exercises per category
- getRecommendedExerciseRange(): Returns recommended exercise range
- getAvailableExercises(): Filters exercises by muscle groups
- autoSelectExercises(): Smart exercise selection algorithm
- clearWorkoutExercises(): Clears all exercises from workout
```

### 4. Visual Enhancement Features

**Progress Tracking:**
- Exercise count display with progress bars
- Color-coded indicators (green for optimal, orange for suboptimal)
- Real-time feedback on selection status
- Recommended vs. actual exercise count comparison

**Interactive Elements:**
- Hover effects on exercise cards
- Selection indicators with checkmarks
- Equipment badges for each exercise
- Muscle group information display

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```tsx
ProgramCustomizer
├── Structure Tab (existing)
├── Category Tab (existing)
└── Workouts Tab (NEW)
    ├── Workout Template Cards
    ├── Exercise Selection Interface
    ├── Auto-select/Clear Controls
    └── Progress Indicators
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface CustomizationConfig {
  structureId: string;
  categoryType: 'MINIMALIST' | 'ESSENTIALIST' | 'MAXIMALIST';
  workoutConfiguration: Record<string, string[]>; // workoutId -> exerciseIds[]
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Exercise Filtering**: Filter available exercises by muscle group compatibility
2. **Selection Logic**: Add/remove exercises with category-based limits
3. **State Update**: Update workout configuration in customization state
4. **Visual Feedback**: Update UI indicators and progress bars
5. **Persistence**: Save configuration via existing API endpoint

## User Interface Components

### Workout Template Cards
- **Header**: Template name, muscle groups, exercise count
- **Controls**: Auto-select and clear all buttons
- **Content**: Exercise selection grid with search/filter
- **Footer**: Progress indicator and recommendation status

### Exercise Selection Interface
- **Exercise Cards**: Name, muscle groups, equipment, selection status
- **Visual States**: Default, hover, selected, disabled
- **Information Display**: Primary/secondary muscle groups
- **Selection Feedback**: Checkmarks and color coding

### Progress Indicators
- **Exercise Counter**: Current count vs. recommended range
- **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of selection progress
- **Status Colors**: Green (optimal), orange (suboptimal), gray (empty)
- **Text Feedback**: \"Recommended\", \"Selected\", status messages

## Category-Based Recommendations

### Exercise Limits by Category
- **Minimalist**: 4-6 exercises per workout (max 6)
- **Essentialist**: 6-8 exercises per workout (max 8)  
- **Maximalist**: 8-12 exercises per workout (max 12)

### Auto-Selection Priority
1. **Compound Movements**: Higher muscle group coverage
2. **Primary Muscle Groups**: Exercises targeting template requirements
3. **Equipment Variety**: Balanced equipment usage
4. **Category Alignment**: Respects user's training philosophy

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Program Data**: Uses existing workout templates and exercise templates
- **Customization API**: Integrates with `/api/programs/customize` endpoint
- **State Management**: Extends existing customization configuration
- **UI Components**: Builds on existing Card, Button, Badge components

### Data Persistence
- **Workout Configuration**: Saved as part of user customization
- **Exercise Selection**: Stored as exercise ID arrays per workout
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate state updates with save confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Toast notifications for save success/failure

## User Workflow

### Complete Customization Flow
1. **Access Program Guide** → Navigate to Customize tab
2. **Select Structure** → Choose training schedule
3. **Choose Category** → Select training philosophy
4. **Customize Workouts** → Select exercises for each workout
5. **Save Configuration** → Persist customization settings

### Workout Customization Steps
