# Exercise Image Upload Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive image/GIF support for exercises with upload functionality in the exercises management page and Supabase storage integration.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema Changes
**File Modified**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `imageUrl` field (String, optional) - stores public URL of uploaded image
- Added `imageType` field (String, optional) - stores MIME type of image

**Migration File Created**: `add-exercise-image-fields.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "imageUrl" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "imageType" TEXT;
```

**Status**: ⚠️ Migration SQL created but NOT YET EXECUTED
**Action Required**: Run the SQL migration on your database:
```bash
# Option 1: Using Prisma CLI (if database allows)
npx prisma db execute --file add-exercise-image-fields.sql --schema prisma/schema.prisma

# Option 2: Copy SQL content and run directly in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Image Upload API
**File Created**: `src/app/api/admin/exercises/upload-image/route.ts`

**Features**:
- **POST Endpoint**: Upload image file to Supabase Storage
  - File validation (type and size)
  - 10MB maximum file size
  - Supported formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Generates unique filename with timestamp
  - Returns public URL and MIME type
  
- **DELETE Endpoint**: Remove image from storage
  - Accepts image URL
  - Extracts file path and deletes from bucket
  - Admin-only access

**Security**: Admin role verification on all endpoints

### 3. Exercise CRUD API Updates
**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/admin/exercises/route.ts` (POST - create exercise)
- `src/app/api/admin/exercises/[id]/route.ts` (PUT - update exercise)

**Changes**:
- Both endpoints now accept `imageUrl` and `imageType` in request body
- Create endpoint stores image data for new exercises
- Update endpoint preserves existing image if not provided in update

### 4. React Component Updates
**File Modified**: `src/components/admin/exercise-management.tsx`

**Interface Updates**:
```typescript
interface Exercise {
  // ... existing fields
  imageUrl?: string;
  imageType?: string;
}

interface ExerciseFormData {
  // ... existing fields
  imageUrl: string | null;
  imageType: string | null;
}
```

**State Management**:
- `imageFile`: File | null - holds selected file before upload
- `imagePreview`: string | null - displays preview of selected image
- `uploadingImage`: boolean - tracks upload status

**Handlers Implemented**:
- `handleImageSelect()`: Validates file type/size, creates preview
- `handleImageUpload()`: Uploads to storage API, returns URL and type
- `handleRemoveImage()`: Clears image state and form data
- `handleEdit()`: Loads existing image data when editing exercise
- `handleSubmit()`: Uploads image before saving exercise data

**UI Components Added**:
- File input for image selection
- Image preview display (shows selected or existing image)
- Remove image button
- Upload status indicator
- Validation messages

### 5. Exercise List Display
**Table Updates**:
- Added "Image" column after "Name" column
- Displays 48x48px thumbnail of exercise image
- Shows "No image" placeholder if no image exists
- Images are rounded and properly styled

### 6. Supabase Storage Setup
**File Created**: `supabase-exercise-images-bucket-setup.sql`

**Bucket Configuration**:
- Bucket name: `exercise-images`
- Public bucket (images accessible via URL)
- 10MB file size limit
- Allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp

**RLS Policies**:
1. **Public Read Access**: Anyone can view exercise images
2. **Admin Upload Access**: Only admins can upload new images
3. **Admin Update Access**: Only admins can update existing images
4. **Admin Delete Access**: Only admins can delete images

**Status**: ⚠️ SQL script created but NOT YET EXECUTED
**Action Required**: Run the SQL script in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Paste content from `supabase-exercise-images-bucket-setup.sql`
3. Execute the script
4. Verify bucket appears in Storage section

## 📋 File Changes Summary

### New Files Created:
1. `add-exercise-image-fields.sql` - Database migration
2. `src/app/api/admin/exercises/upload-image/route.ts` - Image upload API
3. `supabase-exercise-images-bucket-setup.sql` - Storage bucket setup
4. `EXERCISE_IMAGE_UPLOAD_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added imageUrl and imageType fields
2. `src/app/api/admin/exercises/route.ts` - Updated POST endpoint
3. `src/app/api/admin/exercises/[id]/route.ts` - Updated PUT endpoint
4. `src/components/admin/exercise-management.tsx` - Full image support

## 🔄 Complete Upload Flow

1. **Admin selects image file** → `handleImageSelect()`
   - Validates file type (JPEG/JPG/PNG/GIF/WebP only)
   - Validates file size (max 10MB)
   - Creates preview URL using `URL.createObjectURL()`
   - Updates state with file and preview

2. **Admin clicks Save** → `handleSubmit()`
   - Calls `handleImageUpload()` first
   - Uploads file to `/api/admin/exercises/upload-image`
   - Receives public URL and MIME type
   - Updates form data with imageUrl and imageType
   - Proceeds with exercise save (POST or PUT)
   - Exercise saved with image data in database

3. **Image stored and displayed**:
   - File stored in Supabase Storage bucket `exercise-images`
   - Public URL stored in database
   - Thumbnail displayed in exercises list
   - Full image available for viewing

## 🔒 Security Notes

1. **Admin-Only Upload**: Only users with `role = 'admin'` can upload images
2. **Public Read**: All exercise images are publicly accessible (for display to users)
3. **File Validation**: Server-side validation of file type and size
4. **Storage Isolation**: Images stored in dedicated `exercise-images` bucket
5. **URL-based Access**: Images accessed via Supabase public URLs

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Database Migration**:
   - Run `add-exercise-image-fields.sql` on production database

3. **Supabase Storage Setup**:
   - Run `supabase-exercise-images-bucket-setup.sql` in Supabase Dashboard

4. **Deploy Application**:
   - Deploy code changes to production
   - Verify all environment variables are set

5. **Post-deployment Verification**:
   - Test image upload in production
   - Verify images display correctly
   - Check storage bucket in Supabase Dashboard

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Images not uploading:
- Check Supabase storage bucket exists
- Verify RLS policies are active
- Check user has admin role
- Inspect browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key in .env

### Images not displaying:
- Verify bucket is public
- Check image URLs are valid
- Ensure imageUrl is saved in database
- Test URL directly in browser

### File validation errors:
- Ensure file is under 10MB
- Check file type is supported
- Try different image file

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add image cropping/resizing before upload
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Bulk image upload for multiple exercises
- [ ] Image gallery view in admin panel
- [ ] Automatic image optimization (compression)
