# Exercise Recommended Field Implementation

## Summary
Replaced the three-level `difficulty` field (BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED) with a simpler binary `isRecommended` boolean field. Recommended exercises now appear first in the program guide's workout customization interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Removed**: `difficulty` field and `ExerciseDifficulty` enum
- **Added**: `isRecommended Boolean @default(false)` field
- **Migration**: Applied via `prisma db push` (dropped difficulty column, added isRecommended)

### 2. Admin Exercise Management (`src/components/admin/exercise-management.tsx`)
- **Interface Updates**:
  - `Exercise` interface: replaced `difficulty` with `isRecommended: boolean`
  - `ExerciseFormData` interface: same change
  - Removed `DIFFICULTIES` constant array
- **Form UI**:
  - Replaced difficulty `Select` dropdown with `Checkbox` for isRecommended
  - Added descriptive label: "Recommended Exercise (appears first in program guide)"
  - Default value: `isRecommended: false`
- **Table Display**:
  - Changed table header from "Difficulty" to "Recommended"
  - Display recommended badge (‚úì Recommended) or dash (‚Äî) instead of difficulty level
  - Recommended badge uses green color (`bg-green-600`)
- **Form Handling**:
  - Updated `handleEdit` to use `isRecommended` field

### 3. Program Customizer (`src/components/programs/program-customizer.tsx`)
- **Interface**: Updated `Exercise` interface to use `isRecommended: boolean`
- **Sorting Logic**: 
  ```typescript
  .sort((a, b) => {
    // Recommended exercises come first
    if (a.isRecommended && !b.isRecommended) return -1;
    if (!a.isRecommended && b.isRecommended) return 1;
    // Then sort alphabetically by name
    return a.name.localeCompare(b.name);
  })
  ```
- **Exercise Display**:
  - Removed difficulty from exercise card subtitle
  - Added recommended badge: ‚≠ê Recommended (green pill)
  - Shows only equipment list in subtitle

### 4. API Routes
**`src/app/api/admin/exercises/route.ts`** (POST - Create):
- Replaced `difficulty` parameter with `isRecommended`
- Default value: `isRecommended: false`

**`src/app/api/admin/exercises/[id]/route.ts`** (PUT - Update):
- Replaced `difficulty` parameter with `isRecommended`
- Default value: `isRecommended: false`

### 5. Exercise Validation (`src/lib/exercise-validation.ts`)
- **Interface**: Updated `Exercise` interface to use `isRecommended`
- **Context Generation**:
  - Shows `[‚≠ê RECOMMENDED]` badge for recommended exercises
  - Updated AI rules to prefer recommended exercises
  - Changed rule: "Prefer recommended exercises (marked with ‚≠ê) when available"

## Benefits

### 1. Simplified UX
- Binary choice (recommended/not) is easier for admins than 3-level difficulty system
- Clearer intent: "What should we show users first?" vs "How hard is this?"

### 2. Better User Experience
- Recommended exercises surface first in program customization
- Users see expert-approved exercises immediately
- Secondary sorting by name maintains predictable ordering

### 3. Cleaner UI
- Checkbox is more intuitive than dropdown for binary choice
- Green badge draws attention to recommended exercises
- Consistent visual language across admin and user interfaces

### 4. AI-Friendly
- AI system can prioritize recommended exercises in suggestions
- Clearer semantic meaning for exercise selection logic
- Better alignment with coaching priorities

## Database Migration

The schema change was applied using `prisma db push`:

```sql
-- Add isRecommended column with default false
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" ADD COLUMN "isRecommended" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- Drop difficulty column (contained 52 non-null values)
ALTER TABLE "Exercise" DROP COLUMN "difficulty";

-- Drop the ExerciseDifficulty enum type
DROP TYPE "ExerciseDifficulty";
```

**Note**: All 52 existing exercises now have `isRecommended = false` by default. Admins can manually mark exercises as recommended through the admin panel.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] ‚úÖ Prisma client regenerated successfully
- [x] ‚úÖ Database schema updated without errors
- [x] ‚úÖ Next.js build completed successfully
- [x] ‚úÖ ESLint passed with no errors
- [ ] üîÑ Manual testing needed:
  - [ ] Admin: Create new exercise with isRecommended checkbox
  - [ ] Admin: Edit existing exercise and toggle isRecommended
  - [ ] Admin: Verify table displays recommended badge correctly
  - [ ] User: Check program guide shows recommended exercises first
  - [ ] User: Verify sorting works (recommended ‚Üí alphabetical)

## Files Modified

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Schema changes
2. `src/components/admin/exercise-management.tsx` - Admin UI
3. `src/components/programs/program-customizer.tsx` - User UI with sorting
4. `src/app/api/admin/exercises/route.ts` - Create API
5. `src/app/api/admin/exercises/[id]/route.ts` - Update API
6. `src/lib/exercise-validation.ts` - Validation and AI context

## Migration Notes

- **No data reset**: Existing 52 exercises preserved
- **Default value**: All exercises start as `isRecommended = false`
- **Admin action required**: Mark preferred exercises as recommended manually
- **Backward compatibility**: No legacy field support needed (clean break)

## Follow-up Tasks

1. **Data Migration**: Admin should review and mark recommended exercises
2. **Documentation**: Update user guide about recommended exercises
3. **Analytics**: Track which recommended exercises are most selected
4. **A/B Testing**: Measure impact of recommended sorting on user engagement
